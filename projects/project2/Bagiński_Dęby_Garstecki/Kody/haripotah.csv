"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","And the boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Hagrid is bringing him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Rubeus Hagrid","Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Rubeus Hagrid","No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","The only family he has."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Minerva McGonagall","This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Doorstep Delivery","Albus Dumbledore","Good luck...Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Up. Get up.  Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Happy birthday, son."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Yes, Aunt Petunia."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Yes, Uncle Vernon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Aren’t they wonderful, darling?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","How many are there?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","I don't care how big they are!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Make it move."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Vernon Dursley","Move!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","MOVE!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","He's asleep!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","He's boring."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Snake","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Harry Potter","Anytime."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Man","SNAKE!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Mum, mummy!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Dudley Dursley","Mum, help! Help me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Vanishing Glass","Petunia Dursley","My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","It's all right. It's all right."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Ow!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","What happened?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","There's no such thing as magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Will I have to wear that, too?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","What, you? Go to Smeltings?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Yours? Who'd be writing to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","No more mail through this letterbox."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Petunia Dursley","Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Shoo! Go on!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Because there's no post on Sunday?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Go away, ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","What is it? Please tell me what's happening!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Give me that! Give me that letter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","Get off! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Harry Potter","They're my letters! Let go of me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Vernon Dursley","That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Letters from No One","Dudley Dursley","Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Make a wish, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","Who's there? Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Sorry 'bout that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Dudley Dursley","I-I-I'm not Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","I-I am."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Thank you!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Excuse me, who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Sorry, no."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Learned what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","You're a wizard, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","I-I'm a what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Petunia Dursley","Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Petunia Dursley","We had to tell him something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","It's an outrage! It's a scandal!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","He'll not be going!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Muggle?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Vernon Dursley","I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Dudley Dursley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Keeper of the Keys","Rubeus Hagrid","Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Essential bit of equipment, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","But you like a dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","If you know where to go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Tom","Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Tom","Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Man","Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Witch","Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Quirinus Quirrell","Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Oh, nice to meet you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Quirinus Quirrell","F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Goodbye."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","See, Harry, you're famous!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Diagon Alley","Boy","It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry Potter","But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry Potter","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Goblin","And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Goblin","Very well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Vault 713."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Harry Potter","What's in there, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Griphook","Stand back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Gringotts","Rubeus Hagrid","Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","I still need...a wand."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Rubeus Hagrid","A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","Hello? Hello?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Garrick Ollivander","I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","Sorry, but what's curious?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Garrick Ollivander","I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","And...who owned that wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Garrick Ollivander","Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Rubeus Hagrid","Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ollivanders","Harry Potter","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","Maybe if you wrote it down?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","Shh!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","What happened to...to You-Know-Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Boy Who Lived","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Rubeus Hagrid","What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Harry Potter","Platform 93? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 93. There's no such thing...is there?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Man","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Harry Potter","Excuse me, excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Guard","Right on your left, ma'am."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Harry Potter","Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 93?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Guard","93? Think you're being funny, do ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Molly Weasley","It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Harry Potter","Muggles?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Molly Weasley","Come on. Platform 93 this way! All right, Percy, you first."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Molly Weasley","Fred, you next."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","George Weasley","He's not Fred, I am!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Fred Weasley","Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Molly Weasley","Oh, I'm sorry, George."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Fred Weasley","I'm only joking. I am Fred."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Harry Potter","Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Molly Weasley","How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Platform 93","Ginny Weasley","Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","No, not at all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","I'm Harry. Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Scar...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Oh"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Woman","Anything off the trolley, dears?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","No, thanks, I'm all set."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","We'll take the lot!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","I got Dumbledore!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","I got about 6 of him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Hey, he's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","A little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Harry Potter","Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Ahem. Sun-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Ron Weasley","I'm...Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Ron and Hermione","Hermione Granger","Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Rubeus Hagrid","Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Hey, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Whoaa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Rubeus Hagrid","Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Minerva McGonagall","Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Neville Longbottom","Trevor!  Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Minerva McGonagall","The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Draco Malfoy","It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Welcome to Hogwarts","Minerva McGonagall","We're ready for you now. Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Hermione Granger","It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Albus Dumbledore","I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Hermione Granger","Oh, no. Okay, relax."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron Weasley","Mental that one, I'm telling you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Draco Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","SLYTHERIN!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron Weasley","There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Susan Bones."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Ron Weasley","Harry, what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Ronald Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Minerva McGonagall","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It’s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Harry Potter","Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Sorting Hat","Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","Fred Weasley","We got Potter! We got Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Sorting Hat","George Weasley","We got Potter! We got Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Minerva McGonagall","Your attention, please."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Albus Dumbledore","Let the feast...begin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Seamus Finnigan","I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","What's he teach?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Bloody Baron","Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Look, it’s the Bloody Baron!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Hermione Granger","Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Nearly Headless Nick","Like this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Boy","Ravenclaws, follow me. This way."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Neville Longbottom","Seamus, that picture's moving!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Ron Weasley","Look at that one, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Harry Potter","I think she fancies you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Man in a painting","Welcome to Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","The Fat Lady","Password?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Girl","Oh, wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Nick and Other Residents","Percy Weasley","Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","That was bloody brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Minerva McGonagall","Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","We got lost."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Minerva McGonagall","Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","I don't know, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","I don't know, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Severus Snape","Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Seamus Finnigan","Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum.  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Ron Weasley","Ah. Mail's here!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","Can I borrow this?  Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Seamus Finnigan","Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Hermione Granger","I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Neville Longbottom","The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Potions and Parcels","Harry Potter","Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Good afternoon, class."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Class","Good afternoon, Madam Hooch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Class","Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Wow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","With feeling!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione Granger","Up. Up. Up. Up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Oh..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Mr. Longbottom."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Girl","Neville, what are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Students","Neville...Neville..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy","We're not supposed to take off, yet."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Mr. Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Down! Down! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Help!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Come back down this instant!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","AHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Mr. Longbottom-!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Girl","Is he alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Neville Longbottom","Owowowow."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Rolanda Hooch","Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Give it here, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione Granger","Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Draco Malfoy","Is that so?  Have it your way, then!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy","Good job, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Boy 2","Oh, that was wicked, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","Harry Potter?  Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirinus Quirrell","An iguana s-such as this is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","You wait here."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirinus Quirrell","... an essential in-gredient."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Quirinus Quirrell","Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Minerva McGonagall","Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Nearly Headless Nick","Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","A century, according to McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Fred Weasley","Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","George Weasley","Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Fred Weasley","Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","George Weasley","But they'll turn up in a month or two!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Hermione Granger","You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Ron Weasley","Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","New Seeker","Harry Potter","I-I didn't know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Who doesn't?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","The staircases change, remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Let's go this way."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Before the staircase moves again."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","It's Filch's cat!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Quick! Let’s hide though that door!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","It's locked!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","That's it, we're done for!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Alohomora?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Argus Filch","Anyone here, my sweet?  Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","Filch is gone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","Probably thinks this door's locked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","It was locked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","And for good reason."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","All","AHHHHHHH!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Harry Potter","Guarding something?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Hermione Granger","That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Three-Headed Sentinel","Ron Weasley","She needs to sort out her priorities!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I think so. What are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I like this ball."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","What do I do with it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Oliver Wood","You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","Whoa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","All","The swish and flick."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Draco Malfoy","Wingardium Levio-saaa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron Weasley","Wingardrium Leviosar!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Hermione Granger","Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron Weasley","You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Hermione Granger","Wingardium Leviosa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Seamus Finnigan","Wingard Levosa."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Well done, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Filius Flitwick","Whooaaa! Ooh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Ron Weasley","It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Facts and Feathers","Harry Potter","I think she heard you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Neville Longbottom","Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Quirinus Quirrell","TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Albus Dumbledore","SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Girl","Hufflepuff, this way!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Boy","Stay together!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Percy Weasley","Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","How could a troll get in?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Hermione! She doesn't know!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","I think the troll's left the dungeon!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Hermione, move!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Help! Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Hey, pea brain!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Ahhh! Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Ew."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Whoa, whoa whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Anything! Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Swish and flick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","Is it...dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Minerva McGonagall","Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Well, what it is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Well, what it is..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Minerva McGonagall","Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Hermione Granger","I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Minerva McGonagall","Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Quirinus Quirrell","Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe...."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Good for you to get us out of trouble like that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","Mind you, I mean, we did save her life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Harry Potter","Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mountain Troll","Ron Weasley","What are friends for?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","I'm not hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Severus Snape","Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","That explains the blood."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","Blood?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","But why would anyone go near that dog?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","So you're saying..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Hermione Granger","Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","But I-I never get mail."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Let's open it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","It's a broomstick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","But who...?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver Wood","Scared, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","A little."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver Wood","That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","What happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Oliver Wood","Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Rolanda Hooch","Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","Yes!  Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Rubeus Hagrid","Well done!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Ron Weasley","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Seamus Finnigan","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Harry Potter","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Lee Jordan","Another 10 points to Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Gryffindors","Yay!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Marcus Flint","Give me that!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Quidditch","Marcus Flint","Take that side!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Harry Potter","Whoa! Whooa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","What's going on with Harry's broomstick?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron Weasley","Jinxing the broom? What do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","Leave it to me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron Weasley","Come on, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","Lacarnum Inflamarae."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Man","Fire! You're on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Severus Snape","What? Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Ron Weasley","Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","Go go go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","Looks like he's gonna be sick!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Lee Jordan","He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rolanda Hooch","Gryffindor win!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Draco Malfoy","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Hermione Granger","Whoo-hoo!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Interference Overcome","Crowd","Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Who told you ‘bout Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","That thing has a name?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the.."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Exactly."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Nicholas Flamel?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Rubeus Hagrid","I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ghosts","Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Knight to E5."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Queen to E5."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","That's totally barbaric!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","See you haven't."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","We've looked a hundred times."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Hermione Granger","Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","I think we've had a bad influence on her."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Oh. My mum made it.  It looks like you've got one too."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","I-I've got presents?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","There they are."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","It's some kind of cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Well, let's see then, put it on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","Whoa!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","My body's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","I'm invisible?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Ron Weasley","They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Christmas Gift","Harry Potter","There was no name. It just said use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Harry Potter","Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Argus Filch","Who's there?!  I know you're in there. You can't hide.  Who is it? Show yourself!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Quirinus Quirrell","Severus...I-I thought..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Severus Snape","You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Quirinus Quirrell","W-what do you m-mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Severus Snape","You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Cloaked in darkness","Argus Filch","Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Mum?  Dad?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","I only see me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","How can it? Both my parents are dead."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","George Weasley","Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","We go and visit Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Ron Weasley","Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Albus Dumbledore","Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Harry Potter","So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Mirror of Erised","Albus Dumbledore","Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hi, Hedwig."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","I'm ready! Ask me any question."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","...I forgot."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","Copy off you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","Leg-Locker Curse?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","How? I can barely stand at all!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Seamus Finnigan","I'll do the counter-curse!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Seamus Finnigan","I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","I found him!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark"" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–'"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","'-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Follow me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Neville Longbottom","Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","This is light?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","Immortal?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","It means you'll never die."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","I know what it means!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Shh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","We know about the Philosopher's Stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","We think Snape's trying to steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","That? It's a ... its um..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Hermione Granger","Is that...a dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Norbert?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","I don't understand. Is that bad?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Ron Weasley","It's bad."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","Good evening."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Harry Potter","50?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Draco Malfoy","Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Norbert","Minerva McGonagall","No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Argus Filch","A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hermione Granger","Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Argus Filch","Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Argus Filch","There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Right. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","Hagrid, what's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Ron Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","Okay. Then I get Fang!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","What is it, Fang?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Draco Malfoy","HELP!!!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","But what was that thing you saved me from?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","But who would choose such a life?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Can you think of no one?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Harry Potter","The Philosopher's Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","The Forbidden Forest","Firenze","Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Hermione Granger","You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Harry Potter","But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Ron Weasley","But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Harry Potter","I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Ron Weasley","And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Up to Something","Hermione Granger","Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","My scar. It keeps burning."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","It's happened before."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Not like this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Perhaps you should see the nurse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","And did he seem interested in Fluffy?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Rubeus Hagrid","I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Minerva McGonagall","I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Minerva McGonagall","How do you know ?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Someone's going to try and steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Minerva McGonagall","I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","And with Dumbledore gone"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Severus Snape","Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Uh...we were just..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Severus Snape","You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Now what do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","We go down the trapdoor. Tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Trevor."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Neville Longbottom","Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Now, Neville, listen. We were"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Neville Longbottom","No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Let's go.  Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","It's for your own good, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Ow! You stood on my foot!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Alohomora."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Uh. It's got horrible breath!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","We have to move its paw."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","What?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","The harp. It stopped playing."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ew! Yuck! Ugh."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Jump! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ahh!  Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Hermione!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Hermione!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Now what are we gonna do?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Just relax!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Hermione! Where are you?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Do what I say. Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ahh! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","He's not relaxing, is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Apparently not."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Help! Help me!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","We've got to do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumus Solem!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Ahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Ron, are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","I don't know. Sounds like wings."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Curious. I've never seen birds like these."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What's this all about?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","I don't know. Strange."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Hermione Granger","What's wrong, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","It's too simple."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","This complicates things a bit!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Harry Potter","Catch the key!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Through the Trapdoor","Ron Weasley","Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","I don't like this. I don't like this at all."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Harry Potter","Where are we? A graveyard."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Harry Potter","There's the door."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","Now what do we do?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","What happens now?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","Well, white moves first, and then...we play."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Hermione Granger","Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Wizard's Chess","Ron Weasley","You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","Wait a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","No, Ron! No!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","He's going to sacrifice himself!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Check."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Ron Weasley","Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Harry Potter","Not as good as you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Sacrifice Play","Hermione Granger","Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","You?  No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","Snape was trying to save me?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","Then-then you let the troll in."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Use the boy."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","He lies."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Tell the truth! What do you see?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Let me speak to him."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Quirinus Quirrell","Master, you are not strong enough."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","I have strength enough for this."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Harry Potter, we meet again."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Harry Potter","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Man With Two Faces","Voldemort","Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Harry Potter","Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Harry Potter","You liar!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Kill him!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Quirinus Quirrell","Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Magic Touch","Voldemort","Fool! Get the stone!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","Admirers?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Fine. They're both just fine."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","But, what happened to the Stone?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Albus Dumbledore","Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","All right there, Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Ron Weasley","All right? You?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Harry Potter","All right. Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Mark of Love","Hermione Granger","Never better."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Albus Dumbledore","Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Hermione Granger","We're tied with Slytherin!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Albus Dumbledore","And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Rubeus Hagrid","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Seamus Finnigan","Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","House Cup Winner","Lee Jordan","Yeah! We won!!"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Hermione Granger","Come on, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Harry Potter","One minute."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Harry Potter","Thanks, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Harry Potter","But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Rubeus Hagrid","I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh?  Off you go."
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Hermione Granger","Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","Not Really Going Home","Harry Potter","I'm not going home. Not really."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","Now you've done it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Petunia Dursley","He's in there. Vernon…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird it'll have to go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Dudley Dursley","Who'd want to be friends with you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Petunia Dursley","Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Petunia Dursley","…in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Good! And- and Dudley, you will be…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Dudley Dursley","I'll be waiting to open the door!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Excellent! …And you…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Harry Potter","I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","In a cage","Vernon Dursley","Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Why don't you sit down?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho… Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","You can't have met many decent wizards then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Stop, Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Bad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, shh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Baaad Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, please stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","Ohh, don't mind that! It's just the cat."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Your family?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here…ooh… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","What terrible things? Who's plotting them?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Ooo… er… can't… say… argh..."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Ok– I- understand. You can't- say."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Don't make me talk, I— Errr…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Bad Dobby."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","So when they arrive at the ninth hole…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Let me go!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Get in there, and keep quiet!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","What the devil are you doing up here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","I- I was just—"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Yes, sir… See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Well, I expect they've… been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Give me those, now!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","No! Ahh! Ooh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, get back here!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","Dobby, please, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Harry Potter","I can't. Hogwarts is my home!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Dobby","Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","…it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that's just the top of it!”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's warning","Vernon Dursley","I'm so sorry! It's my nephew- he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Vernon Dursley","You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Harry Potter","Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Ron Weasley","Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Car rescue","Ron Weasley","You'd better stand back. Let's go!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","George Weasley","Yeah, Mum would never know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","It's not much, but it's home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","I think it's brilliant"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ginny Weasley","Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Yes dear. It was on the cat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Hello. W-what did I do?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Morning, Weasleys."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","Morning, Dad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","George Weasley","Morning, Dad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Morning, Dad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Morning Arthur!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","What a night. Nine raids. Nine!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Raids?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Well now. Aah! And who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Did you really? How'd it go? Did you—"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","George Weasley","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Oh, it…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Arthur!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","I mean…that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Harry Potter","Oh, umm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Percy Weasley","Errol…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Ron Weasley","He's always doing that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Percy Weasley","Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters. And they've sent us Harry's as well."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Arthur Weasley","Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","Oh, no."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Fred Weasley","This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Burrow","Molly Weasley","We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Ron Weasley","But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Floo powder?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go… That's it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Ron Weasley","Diagon Alley!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","'Diaganilly.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","What did he say, dear?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Arthur Weasley","'Diaganilly.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Molly Weasley","I thought he did."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Other","Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Witch","Not lost are you, my dear?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","I'm fine, thank you. I- I was just…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Other","Come with us. We'll help you find your way back."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","No! Please!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","What do you think you're doing down 'ere? Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","I was lost, I— hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Me? Oh, I was… um… I was lookin' for Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' all the school cabbages."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Harry! Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Oh, it's so good to see you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Well, it's great to see you, too!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","I definitely need to remember that one."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Ok! Bye!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Harry Potter","Thank you. Bye."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","To Diagon Alley","Hermione Granger","Come on! Everyone's been so worried."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Other","Harry… Harry Potter…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Molly Weasley","Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Other","Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Molly Weasley","Ah! Here he is!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Ron Weasley","Mum fancies him."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Photographer","Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Gilderoy Lockhart","It can't be- Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Photographer","Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Gilderoy Lockhart","Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me,… which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving… with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Molly Weasley","Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Draco Malfoy","I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Ginny Weasley","Leave him alone."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Draco Malfoy","Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Harry Potter","Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name…or very foolish."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Hermione Granger","Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see…red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Arthur Weasley","Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Arthur Weasley","Lucius."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Arthur Weasley","We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Lucius Malfoy","Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flourish and Blotts","Draco Malfoy","See you at school."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Arthur Weasley","10:58! Come on! Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Molly Weasley","The train will be leaving any moment!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Arthur Weasley","Fred, George, Percy you first!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Molly Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Arthur Weasley","After you, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Molly Weasley","Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Whao!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Station guard","Oy! What do you two think you're doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","I don't know. The gateway's sealed its self for some reason."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Maybe we should just go and wait by the car."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","The car…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Uh, right. Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Well come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Now all we need to do is catch up with the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","We can't be far behind."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Do you hear that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","We must be gettin' close."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Hold on…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","Wha-aahhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Harry Potter","I think we found the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Flying to Hogwarts","Ron Weasley","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Welcome home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Up! Up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","It's not working! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh… Aahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Be thankful it's not your neck."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Whomping Willow","Argg!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Harry Potter","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Ahh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Whomping Willow","Ron Weasley","Scabbers, you OK? The car! …Dad's gonna kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Harry Potter","See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Argus Filch","Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Severus Snape","You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Ron Weasley","Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Severus Snape","Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Albus Dumbledore","…They are not."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Harry Potter","Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Severus Snape","Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Albus Dumbledore","I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Ron Weasley","We'll go and get our stuff, then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Minerva McGonagall","What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Ron Weasley","You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Not expelled…today","Minerva McGonagall","Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","All","Good morning, Professor Sprout!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Hermione Granger","Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","All","Aah! Ooh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Neville Longbottom","Uhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Seamus Finnigan","No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Pomona Sprout","Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Dean Thomas","Ron? Is that your owl?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Students","Ha-ha… Ha, ha."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Ron Weasley","Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Seamus Finnigan","Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mandrakes - Ron's Howler","Neville Longbottom","Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Oliver Wood","I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What- I don't believe it! Where do you think you're goin', Flint?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Marcus Flint","Quidditch practice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Oliver Wood","I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Marcus Flint","Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","Uh-oh. I smell trouble."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Oliver Wood","“I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.” You've got a new Seeker. Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Malfoy?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Draco Malfoy","That's right. And that's not all that new this year."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Marcus Flint","A gift from Draco's father."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Draco Malfoy","You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Hermione Granger","At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Draco Malfoy","No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Students","Ha, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Draco Malfoy","Ha, ha!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","Wo, this calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothin' to do but wait'll it stops, I'm afraid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Ah! Oh… Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","Better out than in. Who's Ron tryin' to curse, anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Malfoy. He called Hermione, …um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Hermione Granger","He called me a Mudblood."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","He did not!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","What's a Mudblood?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Hermione Granger","It means “dirty blood.” Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call “pure blood.”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","That's horrible!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Ron Weasley","It's disgusting."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Rubeus Hagrid","And it's codswallop, to boot. “Dirty blood.” Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here… Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute… eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Not really."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Basilisk","Come, come, come to me. Come to me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","That voice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","Voice?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Didn't you hear it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Gilderoy Lockhart","What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Mudbloods and murmurs","Harry Potter","Spooky."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Writing on the wall","Basilisk","Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Did you hear it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","Hear what?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","That voice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","Voice? What voice?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just—"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Basilisk","It's time."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","It's moving. I think it's going to kill."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","Kill?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","I don't like spiders… What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened… enemies the heir… beware.' It's written in blood."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Oh, no… It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Students","Ahhh! What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Poppy Pomfrey","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Draco Malfoy","'Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","What's going on 'ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are you…Mrs. Norris? You've…murdered my cat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","No. No."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","I'll kill ya… I'll kill ya!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","Argus! Argus, I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Other","Ravenclaws, follow me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Gilderoy Lockhart","Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","Rubbish!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Severus Snape","If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Gilderoy Lockhart","I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Severus Snape","Yes, Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Argus Filch","My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Albus Dumbledore","We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Strange?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just… strange."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Harry Potter","Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Ron Weasley","Are you mad?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Hermione Granger","No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Kill!","Man in a painting","She's right, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. “One, two, three. Vera verto.”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Ahem. Vera verto!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Students","Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about…the Chamber of Secrets?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Three guesses who."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, “pure-bloods.” Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Muggle-borns."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Minerva McGonagall","Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Harry Potter","Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","If you're talking about Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Harry Potter","Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Ron Weasley","Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","About the Chamber","Hermione Granger","Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Ron Weasley","Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Ron Weasley","Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Harry Potter","Well, how long will it take to make?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","A month."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Harry Potter","A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","I know. But it's the only plan we've got."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Students","Yeah! Come on Slytherin!"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Draco Malfoy","All right there, Scarhead?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Oliver Wood","Watch yourself, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Harry Potter","Wood! Look out!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Rubeus Hagrid","Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Ron Weasley","I'll stop it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Draco Malfoy","Training for the ballet, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Draco Malfoy","You'll never catch me, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Rogue Bludger","Hermione Granger","Let's go."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Hermione Granger","Are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","No, I think my- I think my arm's broken."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","No, not you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this… won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Students","Oh! Ooh! Ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Other","Ohh! Uhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","…you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Rubeus Hagrid","Broken? There's no bones left!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Students","Uh-huh-ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Gilderoy Lockhart","Much more flexible, though."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Draco Malfoy","Uhh, uhhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Hermione Granger","You will be able to, won't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Uh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Basilisk","Kill. Kill… Time to kill!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Hello!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Dobby?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Indeed. Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","You nearly got Ron and me expelled!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Uhuh… Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Uh-huh-huh… Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin…uh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Why do you wear that thing Dobby?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Dobby","Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Harry Potter","No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Poppy Pomfrey","Put him here. What happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Albus Dumbledore","There's been another attack."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Minerva McGonagall","I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Minerva McGonagall","What can this mean, Albus?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Albus Dumbledore","It means…that our students are in great danger."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Minerva McGonagall","What should I tell the staff."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","No longer safe","Albus Dumbledore","The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Heh… No. No one ever comes in here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Moaning Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Moaning Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Who's Moaning Myrtle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Moaning Myrtle","I'm Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn't expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh…aaaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","She's a little sensitive."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Severus Snape","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Whoaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Do you think he's all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Ron Weasley","Who cares?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Severus Snape","Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Severus Snape","Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Good luck, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Harry Potter","Thank you, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","Wands at the ready."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Draco Malfoy","Scared, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Harry Potter","You wish."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Gilderoy Lockhart","On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Draco Malfoy","Everte statium!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Hermione Granger","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Vincent Crabbe","Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dueling Club","Harry Potter","Rictusempra!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Gilderoy Lockhart","I said disarm only!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Draco Malfoy","Serpensortia!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Severus Snape","Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Gilderoy Lockhart","Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Severus Snape","Vipera evenesca."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Justin Finch-Fletchley","What are you playing at?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I'm a what?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","You can talk to snakes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","Oh, that's what you said to it!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","You were there! You heard me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Ron Weasley","Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Harry Potter","But I'm not… I can't be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","A Parselmouth","Hermione Granger","He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Argus Filch","Caught in the act! I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Minerva McGonagall","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","Professor… I swear I didn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Minerva McGonagall","This is out of my hands, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon."

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Sorting Hat","Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","I… I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Sorting Hat","Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","You're wrong."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Sorting Hat","Umm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Rubeus Hagrid","Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Rubeus Hagrid","In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, of course you don't, and… Oh… Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","You don't think it was me, Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Harry Potter","No, sir. Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Nothing to tell","Albus Dumbledore","Very well, then. Off you go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Crabbe and Goyle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","How?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Whose hair are you ripping out then?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode– Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Ahem…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Ron, maybe I should do it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Yeah. Right."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Wingardium leviosa. Here they come."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Vincent Crabbe","It's good right? Ah… Cool!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Vincent Crabbe","Ummm…um."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Gregory Goyle","Ummm…um."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","How thick could you get?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Come on. Let's get 'em."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves… Add the hairs."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Ugh- essence of Crabbe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Cheers!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","I think I'm gonna be sick!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Me too."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Ughh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Uh… Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","Uh… Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Excellent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Ron Weasley","But where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Hermione, are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Hermione Granger","Just go. You're wasting time!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Polyjuice Potion","Harry Potter","Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","I think the Slytherin common room's this way."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Percy Weasley","Excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","What are you doing d- uh, I mean… What are you doing down here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Percy Weasley","I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","Uhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","I'm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","Ah- um… Reading."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","Reading?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","Uh-huh."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Percy Weasley","Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Ron Weasley","Ahem…Stomachache."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Harry Potter","You're wrong!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Harry and Ron transformed.","Draco Malfoy","What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Draco Malfoy","Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","But then you must have some idea who's behind it all."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Draco Malfoy","You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very…odd."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","It's his… stomachache. Calm down."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Ron Weasley","S- scar."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Hair!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Draco Malfoy","Hey! Where are you going?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Ron Weasley","That was close!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Hermione Granger","Go away!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Ahh! Wait till you see. It's awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Harry Potter","Hermione? A- are you OK?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Aaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Hermione Granger","Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Hee, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Ron Weasley","Look at your tail!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Well? Do you?","Moaning Myrtle","Ha, ha, ha!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Ron Weasley","Have you spoken to Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls… What's this?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Ron Weasley","Yuck!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huh– huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","Why would I throw something at you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","Don't ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Ron Weasley","But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Harry Potter","But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The diary","Moaning Myrtle","I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo…"

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","About the school, as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","Is there something you wish to tell me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","No, sir. Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Albus Dumbledore","Very well, then. Off you go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Good night, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","Let's get yeh out of there."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","You can't! You don't understand."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Stand aside, Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Rubeus Hagrid","Aragog! Aragog!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Tom Riddle","I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Harry Potter","Hagrid! Haagriid!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Hello, can you hear me?","Harry Potter","Woah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","That'll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Rubeus Hagrid","Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Rubeus Hagrid","Hello, Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Neville Longbottom","Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Hermione Granger","It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Ron Weasley","Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Harry Potter","And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Petrified","Oliver Wood","Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Fred Weasley","And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Oliver Wood","Well, that too. Professor McGonagall."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","This match has been cancelled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Oliver Wood","We can't cancel Quidditch."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Ron Weasley","Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Minerva McGonagall","Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. “All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.” I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Harry Potter","We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Ron Weasley","But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter.","Harry Potter","I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Who's there? Hello? Hello?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","What's that for?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Hagrid, are you okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","I'm fine! I'm alright."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Did you hear about Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","What you had to understand about that is—  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you… Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Of course! Come in! Come in."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Ron Weasley","That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","Already here, Fudge? Good…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","You think so?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Albus Dumbledore","Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Lucius Malfoy","Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Come, Hagrid… Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Rubeus Hagrid","Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Cornelius Fudge","Good boy."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Ron Weasley","Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter","Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","What?!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be “follow the butterflies?”"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Harry, I don't like this… Harry, I don't like this at all!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Shush!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Can we go back now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","Who is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Don't panic."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","Hagrid? Is that you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Then you're not the monster."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","But have you seen it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Aragog","I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Aragog","Ron Weasley","Ahh- hhh…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Well, thank you. We'll just…go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Aragog","Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Can we panic now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Know any spells?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Where's Hermione when you need her?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Whoah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Whoah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Arania exumai!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Thanks for that."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Go on! Go! Get us in the air."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","The flying gear's jammed!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","Come on! Pull!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","I'm trying!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Ron Weasley","Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Spider attack","Harry Potter","We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin…Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermione…had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Hermione's answered that, too."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","Pipes? It's using the plumbing!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Harry Potter","Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","Moaning Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Gilderoy Lockhart","So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Severus Snape","A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Gilderoy Lockhart","My m-moment?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Severus Snape","Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Gilderoy Lockhart","Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Poppy Pomfrey","Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Minerva McGonagall","Ginny Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Missing","Ron Weasley","'Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","What about my sister?!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Books can be misleading!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","You wrote them!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Is there anything you can do?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah…I'm ah…going to have to do the same to you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Don't even think about it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","Oh! Who's there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","To ask you how you died."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Who was it Myrtle?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","I don't know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh…But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… I died."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Just like that? How?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Hesha- Hassah."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah… There's no need for me to stay."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Oh, yes there is! You first."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Now, boys what good will it do?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Better you than us."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Gilderoy Lockhart","Um…but…obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy down here."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","All right. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Moaning Myrtle","Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Uh…thanks Myrtle."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Aaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Aaah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Ugh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Harry Potter","Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Chamber of Secrets","Ron Weasley","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","This way."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","What's this?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","It looks like a… snake."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","It's a snakeskin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Harry! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","I'm fine!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","Uhh… Hello. Who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Um…Ron Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Gilderoy Lockhart","Really? Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","What'll do I do now?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Ron Weasley","OK."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Backfire","Harry Potter","Hesha- Hassah."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","She won't wake."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not…?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","She's still alive, but only just."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Are you a ghost?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","It won't come until it's called."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Give me my wand, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","You won't be needing it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","But why?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","But, why did you want to meet me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Voldemort is my past, present, and future."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Harry Potter","He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Heir of Slytherin","Tom Riddle","So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Tom Riddle","Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Tom Riddle","No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Tom Riddle","Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very… much… alive!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","The Basilisk","Harry Potter","Ginny-"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Tom Riddle","Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do… especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Harry Potter","Ginny…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Ginny Weasley","Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Harry Potter","Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Healing powers","Gilderoy Lockhart","Amazing! This is just like magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Ron Weasley","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Ron Weasley","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Ron Weasley","Thanks, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um… second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","It's just… You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Not intentionally, but yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Because I asked it to."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Harry Potter","Godric Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Out of the hat","Albus Dumbledore","Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Um-humm…"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Ridiculous!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","How dare you?!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","I beg your pardon?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, yes."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","And? Who was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Ah!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","I see."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Albus Dumbledore","Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Don't worry. I will be."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Ahh! Oow!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Mine? I don't know what you're talking about."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Open it."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Dobby?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Master has given Dobby a sock!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","What? I didn't give."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","You've lost me my servant!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","You shall not harm Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Advada."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Lucius Malfoy","Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Just promise me something."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Dobby","Anything, sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Dobby's reward","Harry Potter","Never try to save my life again."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Other","Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Nearly Headless Nick","Thank you!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Other","Good evening, Sir Nicholas!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Nearly Headless Nick","Good evening!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Other","Good to see you, Sir Nicholas!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Nearly Headless Nick","Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Neville Longbottom","Harry- it's Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Ron Weasley","Uhh-um… Welcome back, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Harry Potter","Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Minerva McGonagall","Could I have your attention, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Albus Dumbledore","Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Hermione Granger","Oh, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Rubeus Hagrid","Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Harry Potter","Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh!"
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","Welcome back","Students","Yeah! Yeah!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Under Covers Prologue","Harry Potter","Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Petunia Dursley","Harry! Harry! Harry, open the door! Marge! How lovely to see..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Nothing. School stuff."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","Later perhaps, if you behave."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","I will if she does."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Oh, you're still here, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","Take Marge's suitcase upstairs!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","Can I tempt you, Marge?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm! You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Petunia Dursley","Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","And a drunk too, no doubt?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","That's a lie!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","What did you say?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","My dad wasn't a drunk!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","I think it's time you went to bed."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Shut up! Shut up!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","Ow! Ripper! Ow! Ripper, get down, boy! Down! Ripper, stop it! Stop! I've got you, Marge! I've got you! Hold on, hold on! Get off!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Marge Dursley","Don't you dare!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","Sorry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Petunia Dursley","Oh, Vernon!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","Oh, God! Marge! Please! Marge! Come back! You bring her back! You bring her back now and you put her right!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","You're not allowed to do magic outside school."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","Yeah? Try me."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Vernon Dursley","They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Aunt Marge's Big Mistake","Harry Potter","I don't care. Anywhere's better than here."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Welcome to the Knight Bus... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. What you doing down there?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","I fell over."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","What you fall over for?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","I didn't do it on purpose."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Well, come on, then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. What you looking at?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Well, come on, then. In. No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in. Come on. Come on. Move on, move on, move on."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Take her away, Ern."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Shrunken head","Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's going to be a bumpy ride."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","What did you say your name was again?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","I didn't."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Whereabouts are you headed?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","You heard that Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Shrunken head","The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... make sure you eat it before it eats you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","But the Muggles. Can't they see us?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Shrunken head","No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, three and a half... two, one and three quarters. Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","Who is that? That man."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Who is that? Who is...? That is Sirius Black, that is. Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. He's a murderer. Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","How did he escape?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Stanley Shunpike","Well, that's the question, isn't it? He's the first one that done it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-Who. I reckon you've heard of him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Harry Potter","Yeah. Him I've heard of."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Knight Bus","Shrunken head","Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. The Leaky Cauldron. Next stop, Knockturn Alley."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Tom","Ah, Mr. Potter, at last."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Stanley Shunpike","Take it away, Ern."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Shrunken head","Yeah, take it away, Ernie!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Tom",": Room 11."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","Hedwig."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge",": Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... and no harm done."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Tom",": Pea soup?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","No, thank you. Minister?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","I don't understand."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","Understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","Come now, Harry the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","The state of things, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","We have a killer on the loose."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Harry Potter","Hedwig."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Leaky Cauldron","Cornelius Fudge","Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Maid","Housekeeping. I'll come back later."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Ron Weasley","I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Hermione Granger","It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Ron Weasley","A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Hermione Granger","That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Ron Weasley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Hermione Granger","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Egypt. What's it like?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Ron Weasley","Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Hermione Granger","You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Ron Weasley","Along with the dung beetle."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Fred Weasley","Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","George Weasley","Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Ron Weasley","I haven't shown anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Fred Weasley","': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","George Weasley","': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Molly Weasley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Mrs. Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Molly Weasley","Good to see you, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Good to see you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Molly Weasley","You got everything you need?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Molly Weasley","Yes? All of your books?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Yeah, it's all upstairs."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Molly Weasley","All of your clothes?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Everything's there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Molly Weasley","Good boy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Mr. Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Harry, wonder if I might have a word?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Yeah, sure."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Hermione Granger","Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Looking forward to a new term?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Yeah. It should be great."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Only that he's escaped from Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Don't say his name."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","When you stopped You-Know-Who... Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","And kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Arthur Weasley","Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","In Grave Danger","Harry Potter","Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Molly Weasley","Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","I still think it was brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Come on. Everywhere else is full."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Who do you think that is?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Professor R.J. Lupin."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Oh."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","Do you think he's really asleep?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Seems to be. Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","I gotta tell you something."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","Thanks, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","What's going on?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","I don't know. Maybe we've broken down."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell! What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","Harry. Harry, are you all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Remus Lupin","Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","What was that thing that came?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Remus Lupin","It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","What happened to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","And did either of you two... you know... pass out?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Ron Weasley","No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Harry Potter","But someone was screaming. A woman."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor","Hermione Granger","No one was screaming, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Albus Dumbledore","Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Hermione Granger","Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Draco Malfoy","Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Ron Weasley","Shove off, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Harry Potter","How did he find out?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Hermione Granger","Just forget it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Albus Dumbledore","Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Seamus Finnigan","Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in. Fortuna Major."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","The Fat Lady","No, no, no. Wait, wait. Watch this. Oh, amazing! Just with my voice."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Harry Potter","Fortuna Major."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","The Fat Lady","Yes, all right. Go in."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Harry Potter","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Harry Potter","She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Seamus Finnigan","She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Ron Weasley",". Green. That's a monkey. What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Seamus Finnigan","Ron, catch."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Ron Weasley","I will."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Seamus Finnigan","I think we have a winner."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Welcome and Warning","Ron Weasley","Oh, don't try one of them. Oh, no. Look at him. His face."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Sybill Trelawney","Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look beyond."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Hermione Granger","What a load of rubbish."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Ron Weasley","Where did you come from?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Hermione Granger","Me? I've been here all this time."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Sybill Trelawney","You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Neville Longbottom","I think so."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Sybill Trelawney","I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Ron Weasley","Sure."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Sybill Trelawney","Look at the cup. Tell me what you see."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Ron Weasley","Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Sybill Trelawney","Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... you have the Grim."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Other","The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... of death."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Ron Weasley","You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Hermione Granger","Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Ron Weasley","Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Hermione Granger","A fair few."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Ron Weasley","Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Tea Leaves","Hermione Granger","Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","Exactly how do we do that?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Neville Longbottom","I'm okay. Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Hermione Granger","I think they're funny."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Harry Potter","Shut up, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","D-Dementor! Dementor!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Hermione Granger","Just ignore him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Ron Weasley","You're supposed to stroke it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Neville Longbottom","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Ron Weasley","Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Harry Potter","Hey, hey, hey!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Ron Weasley","That was wicked, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","Oh, please."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Well done, well done. How am I doing me first day?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Harry Potter","Brilliant, professor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","It's killed me! It's killed me!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Calm down! It's just a scratch!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Hermione Granger","Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","I'm the teacher. I'll do it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","Oh You're gonna regret this."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Rubeus Hagrid","Class dismissed!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Buckbeak","Draco Malfoy","You and your bloody chicken!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Pansy Parkinson","Does it hurt terribly, Draco?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Draco Malfoy","It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. I couldn't do homework for weeks."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Ron Weasley","Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Harry Potter","At least Hagrid didn't get fired."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Hermione Granger","Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Seamus Finnigan","He's been sighted! He's been sighted!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Ron Weasley","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Seamus Finnigan","Sirius Black!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Hermione Granger","Dufftown? That's not far from here."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Other","You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? With dementors at every entrance?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Seamus Finnigan","Dementors? He's already slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Other","That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Dean Thomas","That's a boggart, that is."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Hermione Granger","No one knows."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Ron Weasley","When did she get here?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Hermione Granger","Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","All","Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Very good. A little louder and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","All","Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Draco Malfoy","This class is ridiculous."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Uh... Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Neville Longbottom","Professor Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Neville Longbottom","Professor Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. And I believe you live with your grandmother."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Neville Longbottom","Y-Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Neville Longbottom","She carries a red handbag..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Neville Longbottom","Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line! Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron, wand at the ready."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Ron Weasley","Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Parvati Patil","Riddikulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Boggart in the Wardrobe","Remus Lupin","And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Minerva McGonagall","Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Argus Filch","Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Harry Potter","But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Minerva McGonagall","I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Harry Potter","Forget about it, guys. See you later."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Harry Potter","Professor, can I ask you something?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Remus Lupin","You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Harry Potter","I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Remus Lupin","I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Harry Potter","Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Remus Lupin","Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Harry Potter","I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Talent for Trouble","Remus Lupin","The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Ron Weasley","Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Harry Potter","The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's going on?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Ron Weasley","Probably Neville forgotten the password again."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Neville Longbottom","Hey!."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Ron Weasley","Oh, you're there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Percy Weasley","Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Ginny Weasley","The Fat Lady! She's gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Ron Weasley","Serves her right. She was a terrible singer."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Hermione Granger","It's not funny, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Percy Weasley","Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Make way."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Percy Weasley","The headmaster's here."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Come on, move."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Percy Weasley","You heard. Move!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Argus Filch","There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Percy Weasley","Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! Come back here!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Keep moving!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Dear lady, who did this to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","The Fat Lady","Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Argus Filch","I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir. But there's nothing there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Filius Flitwick","The third floor's clear too, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Very good."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Severus Snape","I've done the dungeons, headmaster. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","I didn't really expect him to linger."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Severus Snape","Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Quite remarkable, yes."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Severus Snape","Any theories on how he managed it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Many. Each as unlikely as the next."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Severus Snape","You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Severus Snape","What about Potter? Should he be warned?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Flight of the Fat Lady","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","Turn to page 394."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Harry Potter","Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Ron Weasley","Werewolves?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Hermione Granger","But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","Quiet."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Ron Weasley","When did she come in? Did you see her come in?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? How disappointing."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Hermione Granger","Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Ron Weasley","He's got a point, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Harry Potter","Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Substitute Teacher","Severus Snape","Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Hermione Granger","Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Albus Dumbledore","Arresto momentum!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Ron Weasley","He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Fred Weasley","Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","George Weasley","Yeah, come on Ron, let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","Probably a right sight better than he normally does."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Hermione Granger","How are you feeling?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","Oh, brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Fred Weasley","You gave us a right good scare there, mate."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","What happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Ron Weasley","Well, you fell off your broom."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","Really? I meant the match. Who won?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Hermione Granger","Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Ron Weasley","There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Remus Lupin","I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Remus Lupin","Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","I'm scared, professor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Remus Lupin","Well I'd consider you a fool if you weren't."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Remus Lupin","There was only one that night."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Harry Potter","But you made it go away."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Grim Defeat","Remus Lupin","I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Argus Filch","Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","Guys, let me go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Clever, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","But not clever enough. Besides, we've got a better way."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Oh. Bless him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Now, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Come and join the big boys."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Come and join the big boys."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","What are you doing?!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","What's this rubbish?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","What's this rubbish? he says. That there it's the secret to our success."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","It's a wrench giving it to you believe me. But we've decided your needs are greater than ours."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","George, if you will."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","We owe them so much."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","In his study."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Pacing."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Does that a lot."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","So you mean this map shows..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Everyone."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","Everyone?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Everyone."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Where they are."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","What they're doing."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Every minute."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Of every day."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Harry Potter","Brilliant! Where did you get it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Knicked it from Filch's office, of course. First year."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Now listen, there are seven secret passageways... out of the castle. We'd recommend"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","This one."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","This one."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","The One-Eyed Witch passageway."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's seller."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","You best hurry. Filch is heading this way."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","Fred Weasley","Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Marauder's Map","George Weasley","Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Other","Now, how much do you want? Delicious."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Hermione Granger","It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Ron Weasley","Twice."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Hermione Granger","Do you want to move a bit closer?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Ron Weasley","To the Shrieking Shack?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Ron Weasley","Actually, I'm fine here."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Draco Malfoy","Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in uh... one room?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Ron Weasley","Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Draco Malfoy","Uh, Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Hermione Granger","Hope you don't mean yourself!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Draco Malfoy","How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? Don't stand there! Do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Vincent Crabbe","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Ron Weasley","What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Draco Malfoy","Get out of the way! Move!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Vincent Crabbe","Malfoy! Wait! Wait!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Who's There?","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Ron Weasley","Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Hermione Granger","But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Ron Weasley","Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Hermione Granger","Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Ron Weasley","That's not true!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Professor McGonagall!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Cornelius!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rubeus Hagrid","Allow me, minister."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Oh, Hagrid..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rubeus Hagrid","Sorry about that."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","We have... We have a killer on the loose!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Come."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Shrunken head","No underage wizards allowed in today! Shut the damn door!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Hermione Granger","So rude."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Ron Weasley","Thick heads."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Shrunken head","Thick heads?! How dare they! Who are they calling thick heads? Young whippersnappers!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits. Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, I can assure you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","Now, tell me what this is all about."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","Peter Pettigrew?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Yes, little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","Ah, I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","And now he wants to finish what he started."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","Mhmm."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","I don't believe it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Cornelius Fudge","Ah, that's not the worst of it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Rosmerta","What could be worse?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Minerva McGonagall","This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Hermione Granger","Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","I Hope He Finds Me","Harry Potter","He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","I'm sure."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Well, everything's prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","Expecto Patronum."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","That's one nasty dementor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","The first time I rode a broom."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","There's another. It's not... happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","I think I've had enough for today."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Remus Lupin","Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","Beautiful day."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Ron Weasley","Gorgeous."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Ron Weasley","Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","Ronald has lost his rat."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Ron Weasley","I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","Rubbish."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Ron Weasley","Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Ron Weasley","Your cat killed him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","Did not."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Ron Weasley","Did."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","Didn't."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Hermione Granger","And then?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Rubeus Hagrid","And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Harry Potter","They're not sacking you!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Patronus","Rubeus Hagrid","No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ron Weasley","Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. I don't wanna tap-dance!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","You tell those spiders Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ron Weasley","Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Rosmerta","Peter Pettigrew?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Minerva McGonagall","Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Cornelius Fudge","Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ghost","Put that light out!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ghost","Watch it there, boy."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ghost","We're trying to sleep here!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ghost","Yes, we are."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Mischief managed. Nox."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","I was sleepwalking."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Spare bit of parchment."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","Why, you insolent little..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","Professor!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","Harry, are you alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Severus Snape","That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Ghost","Are you deaf? Put that light out!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","No. No, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","Oh, really? And who might that be?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","Peter Pettigrew."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Remus Lupin","That's not possible."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Seeing the Impossible","Harry Potter","It's just what I saw. Good night, professor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Sybill Trelawney","Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Hermione Granger","Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Sybill Trelawney","My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Ron Weasley","She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Harry Potter","Hang on. We better take this back."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Ron Weasley","I'm not going back."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Harry Potter","Fine. See you later."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Ron Weasley","See you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Sirius Black","Harry Potter..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Harry Potter","Professor Trelawney..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Sybill Trelawney","He will return tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Harry Potter","Sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Sybill Trelawney","Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Professor Trelawney's Prediction","Harry Potter","No. Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","It just got worse."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Draco Malfoy","Now I'll tell you. Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. Look who's here. Come to see the show?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Vincent Crabbe","Malfoy, are you okay? Let's go. Quick."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Draco Malfoy","Not a word to anyone, understood?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","That felt good."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","Not good, brilliant!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Harry Potter","Why don't we just set him free?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble. He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","We'll stay with you too, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","Scabbers! You're alive!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","I think that means you owe someone an apology."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","I meant me!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Blimey! What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Harry Potter","Ow! Hagrid!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, crikey."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Cornelius Fudge","Very interesting."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Albus Dumbledore","No, minister. Over this way."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Harry Potter","Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Go on, go on!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Albus Dumbledore","Yes, that's the... lings you see over there..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Cornelius Fudge","On the slope."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Albus Dumbledore","On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Professor Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Cornelius Fudge","Good evening."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Minister. Just make your way through. Have a tea, if you like."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Cornelius Fudge","No, Hagrid, thank you. Now gentlemen..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Albus Dumbledore","I'd like to have a cup of tea."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Cornelius Fudge","Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Dear, dear..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Albus Dumbledore","Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Cornelius Fudge","The execution shall dispatch..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Hermione Granger","I thought I just saw... Never mind."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","Let's go!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Rubeus Hagrid","Buckbeak didn't mean no harm."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Witnesses to an Execution","Ron Weasley","Oh, no."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Ron Weasley","He bit me! Scabbers!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Ron. Ron! Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Ron Weasley","Scabbers, come back!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Harry Potter","Wait!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Ron Weasley","Scabbers, you bit me!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Harry Potter","That's not good. Ron, run!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Ron Weasley","Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Ron Weasley","Help!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Harry Potter","Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Duck!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Oh, I'm sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Harry Potter","Don't worry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","Where do you suppose this goes?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Harry Potter","I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Womping Willow","Hermione Granger","We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Harry Potter","Come on. Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Hermione Granger","Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Ron Weasley","Harry it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Hermione Granger","If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","No. Only one will die tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Harry Potter","Then it'll be you!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you Remus? I found him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","I know."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","It's him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","I understand."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","Let's kill him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Hermione Granger","No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","How long have you known?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Hermione Granger","Since Professor Snape set the essay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age, I've ever met."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","Wait!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Sirius Black","I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Harry Potter","I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're dead!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Remus Lupin","No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Sirius Black","Harry Potter","Who was it, then?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Severus Snape","Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Severus..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Severus Snape","I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Brilliant, Snape. Once again you've put your keen penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business... to attend to."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Severus Snape","Give me a reason. I beg you!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","Severus don't be a fool."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","He can't help it. It's habit."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","Sirius be quiet."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Be quiet yourself Remus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Severus Snape","Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Severus Snape","I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","Severus, please."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Severus Snape","After you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Ron Weasley","Harry! What did you just do?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Hermione Granger","You attacked a teacher!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","Tell me about Peter."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","The map was lying, then."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Ron Weasley","Me?! He's mental!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Not you! Your rat!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Ron Weasley","Scabbers has been in my family for..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Ron Weasley","So what?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","All they could find of Pettigrew was his..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","Finger! That dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","Show me. Give it to him, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Ron Weasley","What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Peter Pettigrew","Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you! You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Peter Pettigrew","I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? What would you have done?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Sirius Black","I would have died! I would have died, rather than betray my friends!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Peter Pettigrew","Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... Your dad would have spared me! He would show me mercy!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","You should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Remus Lupin","Harry, this man..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Peter Pettigrew","Bless you, boy! Bless you!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Peter Pettigrew","Harry Potter","Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","You better go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","You go, I'll stay."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","You okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","I'm fine. Go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","That looks really painful."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","So painful. They might chop it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Peter Pettigrew","Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Remus Lupin","Get away from her!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","I know."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","What? Come and live with you?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Sirius Black","Remus! Remus! Run! Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","Wait! Wait!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Hermione Granger","Professor? Professor Lupin?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Ron Weasley","Nice doggy. Nice doggy!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Severus Snape","There you are, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Harry Potter","Sirius!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Friends Become Foes","Severus Snape","Come back here, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor's Kiss","Harry Potter","Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Dementor's Kiss","Hermione Granger","Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Harry Potter","I saw my dad."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Hermione Granger","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Harry Potter","He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Hermione Granger","Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Harry Potter","You mean they're gonna kill him?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Hermione Granger","No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Harry Potter","It's true. Sirius is innocent."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Ron Weasley","It's Scabbers who did it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Albus Dumbledore","Scabbers?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Ron Weasley","He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Hermione Granger","The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Albus Dumbledore","I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Ron Weasley","What the bloody hell was that all about?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Hermione's Secret","Hermione Granger","Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","What just happened? Where's Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","7:30. Where were we at 7:30?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","Come on. And we can't be seen."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","That's us."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Ron Weasley","Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","This is not normal."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","You mean we've gone back in time?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","Good punch."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","Thanks. Malfoy's coming."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Vincent Crabbe","Run."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Draco Malfoy","Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Hermione Granger","That felt good."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Ron Weasley","Not good, brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Onlookers to the Rescue","Harry Potter","Come on. We should be at Hagrid's."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Look. Buckbeak's still alive."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Here they come. I'd better hurry."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Ron Weasley","Scabbers, you're alive!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Rubeus Hagrid","Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","That's Pettigrew."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Harry, you can't."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Are you mad?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Ow!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Ow! That hurt!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","I thought I just saw... Never mind."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Ron Weasley","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Get away. Get off."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Your name only."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","It's such a very long name..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Look beyond the rocks."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","What am I supposed to see?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","And all the strawberries, you see?."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","I see no strawberries."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Over there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Over there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","This way."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Let's get this over, please."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","All right."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. Not a moment ago!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","How extraordinary."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Rubeus Hagrid","Buckbeak."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","Buckbeak."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Cornelius Fudge","Right. Well, well. We must search the grounds."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Albus Dumbledore","Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","We save Sirius."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","How?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","No idea. Look. It's Lupin."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Remus Lupin","Immobulus!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","And Snape's coming."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Harry Potter","And now we wait."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Saving Lives","Hermione Granger","And now we wait."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","At least someone's enjoying himself."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Yeah. Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Yeah?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Here we come."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","That's great."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Harry! Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Let's go! What are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Saving your life!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","That was so scary."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","This is horrible."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Harry, listen to me. No one's coming."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","You're dying... both of you. Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","Expecto Patronum!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","No."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","But I don't like flying...!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","Bombarda!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Sirius Black","I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","I want to go with you."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Sirius Black","One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... you're meant to be here."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","But you're innocent."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Sirius Black","And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. You have..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Harry Potter","My mother's eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Sirius Black","It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Truly Seen, Truly Free","Hermione Granger","We have to go."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Two Places at Once","Albus Dumbledore","Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Two Places at Once","Harry Potter","He's free. We did it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Two Places at Once","Albus Dumbledore","Did what? Good night."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Two Places at Once","Ron Weasley","How did you get there? I was talking to you there. And now you're there."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Two Places at Once","Hermione Granger","What's he talking about, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Harry Potter","I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Remus Lupin","Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Harry Potter","You've been sacked."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Remus Lupin","No. No. I resigned, actually."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Harry Potter","Resigned? Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Remus Lupin","Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Harry Potter","But Dumbledore..."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Remus Lupin","Dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Remus Lupin","Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Harry Potter","None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","Mischief Managed","Remus Lupin","Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Ron Weasley","Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Neville Longbottom","Harry. Wherever did you get it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Seamus Finnigan","Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Harry Potter","What are you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Ron Weasley","Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Fred Weasley","Did not."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","George Weasley","Did not."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Students","It's a Firebolt. It's the fastest broom in the world."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Harry Potter","For me? But who sent it?"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Ron Weasley","No one knows."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Hermione Granger","This came with it."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Neville Longbottom","Go on, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Seamus Finnigan","Yeah, let's see."
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","The Firebolt","Hermione Granger","How fast is it, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Old man","Bloody kids."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Peter Pettigrew","Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Bartemius Crouch Junior","I will not disappoint you my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Riddle House","Voldemort","Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Hermione Granger","Are you alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Hermione Granger","Just now. You?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Last night."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Hermione Granger","Wake up. Wake up Ronald!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Hermione Granger","Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Where are we actually going?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Ron Weasley","Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Haven't the foggiest, keep up!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Arthur! It's about time son."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Cedric Diggory","Yes sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Yes sir. This way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Great great pleasure."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Pleasure to meet you too sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","That's it sir, just over there."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Shall we? We don't want to be late."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Fred Weasley","That isn't just any old manky boot mate."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","George Weasley","It's a portkey."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Time to go. Ready?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","What's a 'portkey'?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","After 3. One... Two..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Three!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Let go kids!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Hermione Granger","What??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Let! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Amos Diggory","Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","See ya later Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Home sweet home."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Fred Weasley","Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","George Weasley","Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Arthur Weasley","Feet off the table."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Fred Weasley","Feet off the table."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","George Weasley","Feet off the table."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Portkey","Harry Potter","I love magic."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Ron Weasley","Blimey Dad, how far up are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Lucius Malfoy","Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Draco Malfoy","Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Lucius Malfoy","Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Arthur Weasley","Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Fred Weasley","It's the Irish!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Here come the Bulgarians!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Fred Weasley","Krum!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Krum!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Ron Weasley","Krum!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","George Weasley","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Quidditch World Cup","Announcer","Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ginny Weasley","Think you're in love Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Fred Weasley","Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","George Weasley","Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Fred Weasley","When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","George Weasley","When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Fred Weasley","Sounds like the irish have got their pride on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Stop! That's my son."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","Which of you conjured this?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","You can't possibly.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","Crime?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Barty, they're just kids."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","What crime?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","Harry it's his mark."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","There was a man. Before. There."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Bartemius Crouch","All of you, this way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Arthur Weasley","Harry, who?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","I dunno. I didn't see his face."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Trolley witch","Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Trolley witch","Anything from the trolley dears?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","On second thought, just the drewbals."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","It's alright I'll get it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Just the drewbals, thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Cho Chang","Two pumpkin pasties please."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Cho Chang","Thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Trolley witch","Anything sweet for you dear?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","Oh no thank you I'm not hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Ron Weasley","Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Harry Potter","I'm fine."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Dark Mark","Hermione Granger","You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Rubeus Hagrid","Clear the runway."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Harry Potter","Well there's something you don't see every day."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Student","Blimey, that's one big woman."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Ron Weasley","Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Igor Karkaroff","Albus!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Igor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Olympe Maxime","Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Olympe Maxime","But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Filius Flitwick","You idiot!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Fred Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Hermione Granger","Alastor Moody? The aura."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Ron Weasley","He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","My dear old friend, thanks for coming."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Alastor Moody","That stupid roof."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Seamus Finnigan","What's that he's drinking do you suppose?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Harry Potter","I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Bartemius Crouch","After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","George Weasley","That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Triwizard Tournament","Albus Dumbledore","Silence!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Goblet of Fire","Albus Dumbledore","The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Alastor Moody."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Three sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","And they are so named?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Seamus Finnigan","Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","So, which curse shall we see first?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Yes..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Give us a curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Hello. What a little beauty."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Don't worry. Completely harmless."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","But if she bites... she's lethal!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","What are you laughing at?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Neville Longbottom","There's the um... The cruciatus curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","Neville?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Son. You alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Alastor Moody","Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Ron Weasley","Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Harry Potter","Yeah well rather you than me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","Cooked it up just this morning."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","It's not going to work."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","Oh yeah? And why's that Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","So?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Hermione Granger","So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","That's why it's so brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","Ready Fred?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","Fred Weasley","Ready George?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Unforgivable Curses","George Weasley","You said.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Harry Potter. Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Rubeus Hagrid","No... No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Hermione Granger","Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Student","He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Harry Potter","No sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Harry Potter","No sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","You're absolutely sure?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Harry Potter","Yes sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Olympe Maxime","Well of course he is lying."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Alastor Moody","The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Igor Karkaroff","You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Alastor Moody","It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Albus Dumbledore","That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Four Champions","Bartemius Crouch","The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","What do you suggest Minerva?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","You heard Barty the rules are clear."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Severus Snape","Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Minerva McGonagall","Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Alastor Moody","I can do that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Albus Dumbledore","Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","How did you do it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Harry Potter","Let you know what?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","You know bloody well what."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Harry Potter","I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Harry Potter","I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Let Events Unfold","Ron Weasley","Piss off."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","What a charismatic quartet. Hello!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","This is cosy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","It's a broomcupboard."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","Oh, no."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","I'm fourteen."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","I dunno I haven't really thought about it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","Fourteen."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","No I didn't enter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Rita Skeeter","Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry.  Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter","Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S...."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","The bird bites."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Sirius?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Rita Skeeter","Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Sirius?! How..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","I dunno."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","You didn't hear a name?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","What are you saying?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","I'm not ready for this Sirius."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","You don't have a choice."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Someone's coming!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Sirius Black","Keep your friends close Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Ron Weasley","Who you talking to?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Who says I was talking to anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Ron Weasley","I heard voices."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Harry Potter","Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Sirius Conversation","Ron Weasley","You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Neville Longbottom","Amazing. Amazing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Neville! You're doing it again!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Neville Longbottom","Oh, right sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Neville Longbottom","Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Is that right? Well.... what?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","Uhhh..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Well you can tell Ronald..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Hermione Granger","I'm NOT an owl!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Bonsoir Olympe."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Couldn't forget you Olympe."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","You'll be glad you came. Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Ahh, c'est magnifique!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Olympe Maxime","Can we get closer?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","Ron was here?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Hungarian Horntail","Harry Potter","No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Student","Cedric rules!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Student","Like the badge?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Excuse me.."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Can I have a word?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Cedric Diggory","Alright."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Cedric Diggory","Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Cedric Diggory","Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Don't worry about it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","You're a right foul git you know that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Ron Weasley","You think so?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","I know so."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Ron Weasley","Anything else?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Yeah. Stay away from me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Ron Weasley","Fine."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Draco Malfoy","Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","Professor Moody what are you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Teaching."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","Is that a student?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Technically it's a ferret."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Draco Malfoy","My father will hear about this!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Is that a threat!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","He might've mentioned it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Minerva McGonagall","Well you will do well to remember it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","Better than fair the way I heard it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Harry Potter","But I'm not allowed a broom."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Transforming Malfoy","Alastor Moody","You're allowed a wand."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Pssst! Harry? Is that you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Battle a dragon."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Rita Skeeter","Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Viktor Krum","You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Rita Skeeter","No matter. We've got what we wanted."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","What are you doing here Miss Granger?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Barty. The bag."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The welsh green. Mr Krum..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The chinese fireball. Oooooh."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The swedish short-snout. Which leaves..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","The horntail..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","What's that boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Bartemius Crouch","The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Albus Dumbledore","Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Your wand harry! Your wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","George Weasley","We knew you wouldn't die Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Fred Weasley","Lose a leg."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","George Weasley","Or an arm."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Fred Weasley","Pack it in altogether."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Seamus Finnigan","Go on Harry, what's the clue?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","What the bloody hell was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Fred Weasley","Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Caught on have you. Took you long enough."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","At least I warned you about the dragons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Hagrid warned me about the dragons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Boys."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Nigel Wolpert","Parcel for you Mr Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Thank you Nigel."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Not now Nigel. Later. Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Harry Potter","Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Ginny these must be for you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ginny Weasley","I'm not wearing that it's ghastly."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","What are you on about?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Hermione Granger","They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The First Task","Ron Weasley","Dress robes? for what?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Fred Weasley","Try saying that five times faster."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Ron Weasley","Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Now, place your right hand on my waist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Ron Weasley","Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","My waist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Now bend your arm. Mr Filch..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","One two three, one two three, one two three."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Harry Potter","Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Fred Weasley","Never."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","George Weasley","Never."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Everybody come together."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Best Foot Forward","Minerva McGonagall","Boys, on your feet."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","I think I'd take the dragon right now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Rubeus Hagrid","I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Rubeus Hagrid","And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Well, us and Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","But then again he can take himself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Now I'm really depressed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Well Hermione, you're a girl."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","Oh well spotted."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Agreed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Cho!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Ok thanks. Cho?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Um.  I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Sorry? I didn't catch that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Cho Chang","Harry I really am sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","What happened to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Student","He just asked Fleur Delacour out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","What did she say?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","No of course."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Hermione Granger","She said yes??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Don't be silly."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Student","Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","What did you do then?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Ron Weasley","What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Parvati Patil","Hi Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Padma Patil","Hi Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","An Unexpected Challenge","Harry Potter","Hey!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","What are those??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","My dress robes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Well I expect yours are more traditional."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Leave it alone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","Hello boys. Don't you look..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","... dashing."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Minerva McGonagall","Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Ready professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Minerva McGonagall","To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Minerva McGonagall","Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","She looks beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","Yeah she does."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Padma Patil","Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","No. Absolutely not."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","Harry. Take my waist."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Parvati Patil","Now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","What's got your wand in a knot?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Padma Patil","Are you going to ask me to dance or not?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","He's using you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Doubt it. He's way too old."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","What? What? That's what you think?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Yeah that is what I think."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","You know the solution then don't you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","Well that's completely off the point. Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Ron Weasley","They get scary when they get older."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Hermione Granger","Ron you spoil everything!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Voldermort","Let me see it again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Voldemort","Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Yule Ball","Neville Longbottom","You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","What's that supposed to mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","Hey Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","How are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Spectacular."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Cedric Diggory","It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","I must be out of my mind."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","I'd try putting it in the water if I were you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Myrtle!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Long time no see."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Well go on, open it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Merpeople","Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Moaning Myrtle","Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Harry, tell me again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Come seek us where our voices sound."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","The black lake, that's obvious."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","An hour long you'll have to look."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Alastor Moody","Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Hermione Granger","But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Alastor Moody","Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Alastor Moody","Why don't you help Potter put his books back."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Neville Longbottom","You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Harry Potter","Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Egg's Clue","Neville Longbottom","I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","You're sure about this Neville."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Absolutely."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","For an hour."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Most likely."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Most likely?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","You're telling me this now? You must be joking."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","I just wanted to help."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","You seem a little tense Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Do I?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Alastor Moody","Put that in your mouth."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","You may begin at the start of the cannon."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Seamus Finnigan","What's the matter with him?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Dean Thomas","I don't know I can't see him."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Neville Longbottom","Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","But she's my friend too!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Merpeople","Only one."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Bartemius Crouch","Get him another towel."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","I want all the judges over here now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Fleur Delacour","You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Fleur Delacour","Thank you! And you... . You helped!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Ron Weasley","Well... yeah... a bit"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Ron Weasley","Merci."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","Hermione"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Hermione Granger","Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Harry Potter","I finished last Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Hermione Granger","Next to last."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Albus Dumbledore","For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Fred Weasley","All that moral fibre eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","Ron Weasley","Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Second Task","George Weasley","Well done 'moral fibre'."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Bartemius Crouch","Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Alastor Moody","Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Alastor Moody","And they say I'm mad."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Rubeus Hagrid","So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Ron Weasley","We're still misfits."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Rubeus Hagrid","Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Never Whole Again","Harry Potter","Mr Crouch?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","Then for once show them some."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","What did you say? What did you say to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Alastor Moody","Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Cornelius Fudge","Harry! Harry how good to see you again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Harry Potter","I can come back later Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Harry Potter","Agh!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Harry Potter","Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I do sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","What do you wish to present?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Mr Rosier is dead."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Alastor Moody","Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I didn't know."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","If that is all the witness has to offer..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Albus Dumbledore","The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Silence!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","What's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","The name..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","The name! Give me the wretched name!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Igor Karkaroff","Barty Crouch! ... Junior."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch Junior","Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Pensieve","Bartemius Crouch","You are no son of mine."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","Have there been other dreams like this?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Albus Dumbledore","Cast them away."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Igor Karkaroff","It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Yes sir."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","Bubble juice sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Harry Potter","I haven't stolen anything."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Dreams and Suspicions","Severus Snape","Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Alastor Moody","Champions! Prepare yourselves."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Albus Dumbledore","On the count of three... ONE..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","Fleur? Fleur!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Get down!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","No stop! He's bewitched Cedric."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Get off me!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","He's bewitched!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Harry! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","For a moment so did I."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Some game huh?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","Some game."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Cedric Diggory","Go. Take it, you saved me!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Third Task","Harry Potter","Together, on three. One, two, three!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","You ok?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","Yeah, you?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","Where are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","I've been here before."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","What are you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","Get back to the cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Cedric Diggory","Who are you? What do you want?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","Kill the spare."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Harry Potter","Cedric!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","Do it, now!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Bones of the father, unwillingly given."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Blood of the enemy forcibly taken."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","The dark lord shall rise again."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","My wand Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","Hold out your arm."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Peter Pettigrew","Master. Thank you master."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Flesh, Blood and Bone","Voldemort","The other arm Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Not even you, Lucius."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Lucius Malfoy","My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","There were signs my friend, and more than whispers."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Lucius Malfoy","I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Peter Pettigrew","I returned."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Peter Pettigrew","Thank you master, thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Oh, such a handsome boy."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Harry Potter","Don't touch him."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","That's better. And now..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Harry Potter","Have it your way."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","The Death Eaters","Voldemort","Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","James Potter","Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Cedric Diggory","Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Lily Potter","Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Voldemort","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Albus Dumbledore","Harry! Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Albus Dumbledore","Tell me what happened!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Harry Potter","He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Albus Dumbledore","It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Cornelius Fudge","Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Priori Incantatem","Amos Diggory","Let me through! That's my son! My boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Are you alright Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Does it hurt?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","Not so much now."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","I'd better take a look at it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","What was it like? What was he like?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Severus..."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Do you know who I am?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","Albus Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Is he in this room? Is he in this room?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Harry get away from there!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Are you alright Alastor?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Alastor Moody","I'm sorry Albus."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Harry Potter","That's Moody, but then who's...?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Severus Snape","Polyjuice potion."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","We'll get you up in a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Barty Crouch Junior."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Bartemius Crouch Junior","I'll show you mine if you show me yours."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Your arm Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Bartemius Crouch Junior","You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Bartemius Crouch Junior","I'll be welcomed back like a hero."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Veritaserum","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Harry Potter","Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Albus Dumbledore","No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Viktor Krum","Write to me. Promise."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Bye."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Fleur Delacour","Au revoir Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Ron Weasley","Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","No."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Harry Potter","No I don't think so."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Everything's going to change now isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you."
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Ron Weasley","Well I won't. You know I won't!"
"Harry Potter and the Gobelt of Fire","Parting Ways","Hermione Granger","Harry will won't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","Oh, it's you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Gang thug","What should we do with him, Big D?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","Shut up!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Arabella Figg","You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. ""No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"""
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","Why should I?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","G-go home!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Gang thug","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","Get out of here!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","Don't point that thing at me!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Dudley Dursley","What's happening?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Quiet!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Dudley! Run!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Dudley, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Lumos!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","""Expecto Patronum!'"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Voldemort","Bow to death, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Lily potter","Haaaaaaaarry!..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","""Expecto Patronum! '"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","What the heii are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Dementors."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Petunia Dursley","What happened, Duddikins?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","What the hell is a dementoid?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Petunia Dursley","They didn't--?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","I want some answers!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","We were attacked."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","By those...things?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","How do you know that?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Vernon Dursley","Why is he all right then?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dudley Demented","Harry Potter","Because I used magic to save his"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","Lumos!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Vernon Dursley","Who are all you lot?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Quiet, Dursley."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","What are you doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","How'd he know? It just happened!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","We're not talking about it here, it's too risky."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Blast it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Nymphadora Tonks","Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","How are we getting there?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","Brooms."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Kingsley Shacklebolt","There's the first signal."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Right, let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","On your broom, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Nymphadora Tonks","Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","Uh, is that very likely?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Kingsley Shacklebolt","No one's going to die."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","There's the second signal!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","The third signal, everyone. Let's"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Stay in formation!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","We need more height!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Contacts to the south!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Kingsley Shacklebolt","Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","There's the other one, Alastor!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","Expecto--!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","Harry, leave it to us!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","""Expecto Patronum!'"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Remus Lupin","Get Harry to the safe house!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Come on, Potter! Keep moving!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Harry Potter","But I can help!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","We're not far, now!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Did you get rid of them?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Kingsley Shacklebolt","They're gone, Alastor."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Nymphadora Tonks","We're there!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Advance Guard","Alastor Moody","Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Remus Lupin","Stay here, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Kingsley Shacklebolt","Clear!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Alastor Moody","Right, Harry, this way."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Alastor Moody","Here, read this."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Alastor Moody","Come on, inside. Hurry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Remus Lupin","Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Walburga Black","Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Sirius Black","Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Walburga Black","Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Harry Potter","Was that your--?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Sirius Black","Mother, yes. Dear old mum."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Harry Potter","But...why here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Molly Weasley","Hello, Harry dear."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Harry Potter","Mrs. Weasley!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Molly Weasley","Sirius, the meeting is about to start!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Sirius Black","Right."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place","Molly Weasley","Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","Let him breathe, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","Good to see you, mate."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","Come on, inside."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Right."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","He thought you would be safest there."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","So, why's he keeping me in the dark?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Didn't you bother asking?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","You've still been here!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","What's been going on?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","What's this Order everyone's talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","You can come down now, the meeting's over."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","Arthur-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","Well, the Ministry is furious with you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","He has a right to know, Molly."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","It's not your decision!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","He's not a child, Molly."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","He's not an adult either!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","I only have Harry's best interests at heart."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","He's not your son."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","Who else does he have, then?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","He's got me. He's like a son to me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","What do you want to know, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","How?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","And what's his plan?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","He's building up his army again, just like before."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","And you're stopping him from gaining followers?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Remus Lupin","We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","But...why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Remus Lupin","Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","But you're telling people, right?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Remus Lupin","But Dumbledore is doing all he can."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Arthur Weasley","If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Sirius Black","You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","What kind of weapon?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Remus Lupin","I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","No, my scar kept hurting."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Yeah...nerves..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Molly Weasley","Good luck, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Harry Potter","Thanks, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","What does he get a hug for?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","Oh, sure, that's why."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Ron Weasley","Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Order of the Phoenix","Hermione Granger","Would you like a hug?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Well, come on, Harry. Time to go."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Harry Potter","Bye."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Good, good, not very many Muggles."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Well, come on Harry, in we go."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Witch","Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Witch","Pleas stand by."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Keep close, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Ah, Perkins, good morn-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Perkins","Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Perkins","It started at eight!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Witch","Department of Mysteries."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Harry Potter","Department of Mysteries?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Come on, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Harry Potter","I've been there before..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Ministry of Magic","Arthur Weasley","There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","You're late."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","Er...sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","No matter, the accused will take his seat."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Very well, we are ready to begin."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Albus Dumbledore","Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Well. The...ah...charges."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","Yes, but-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Within full sight of a Muggle?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","Yes, but-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","It doesn't matter how impressive it was!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","But I did it because of the Dementors!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","What do you mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Harry Potter","My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","Dementors in Little Whinging?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","We haven't got time to-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Full name?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Arabella Figg","Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","So...what is your story?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Arabella Figg","I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","What did the Dementors look like?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Arabella Figg","Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","Anything else?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Arabella Figg","I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Very well, you may go."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Not very convincing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Susan Bones","Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Albus Dumbledore","Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Dolores Umbridge","Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Dementors are irrelevant!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Cornelius Fudge","All opposed?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hearing","Albus Dumbledore","Excellent."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","You were tried by the full court?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","I think so, yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","Er...is Percy mad at you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Lucius Malfoy","Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","What are you doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Lucius Malfoy","Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Lucius Malfoy","Shall we continue this in your"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Cornelius Fudge","Certainly."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Settle down, you three!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","Yeah, absolutely."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Fred Weasley","George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","George Weasley","Right you are, Fred."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Arthur Weasley","Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","You all right, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","Harry, I've got something that might interest you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...;"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","My parents."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","I miss them, Sirius..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","Kreacher, get out of here! Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Kreacher","Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Harry Potter","Who..who was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Originals","Sirius Black","Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Hermione Granger","Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Hermione Granger","What about you, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Hermione Granger","Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","I'm sure. Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Ron Weasley","Come on, lets go back downstairs!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","Yes, do go enjoy yourselves."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","Yes it is, it's right there!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Luna Lovegood","I see them too, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","Er...you are?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Luna Lovegood","Luna. Luna Lovegood."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","Well, thanks Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","Hagrid's cabin looks deserted."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Hermione Granger","I hope he's all right..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Ron Weasley","What if he were still on his..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Ron Weasley","What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Luna Lovegood","Harry Potter","Yeah, could be."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Albus Dumbledore","I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Albus Dumbledore","... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Albus Dumbledore","Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Albus Dumbledore","Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-—"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Dolores Umbridge","Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Dolores Umbridge","Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Dean Thomas","So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Seamus Finnigan","Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Harry Potter","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Seamus Finnigan","Well...because of you..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Harry Potter","What did I do?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Seamus Finnigan","She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Harry Potter","Where'd she get that from?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Harry Potter","No one believes me, Hedwig. No one..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Preserve, Perfect and Prune","Harry Potter","I'm alone..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Sorry, Professor..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Copy this down."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","I wanted to know something about your course aims."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Well, they should be perfectly self- evident."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","No, but-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","What good's theory in the real world?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","What about Lord Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","It-is-NOT-a-LIE!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","The boy's death was a tragic accident."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","It was MURDER! I saw it happen!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Yeah, talk to somebody who cares."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Dolores Umbridge","That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Yeah. But she called me a liar!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Yes, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Minerva McGonagall","Good. Off you go."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Ron Weasley","You reckon she's here to spy on us?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Oh! Sorry..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Angelina Johnson","Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","I'll never get out of it, Angelina."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Angelina Johnson","Well, just...don't do it again!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Ron Weasley","Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Later, I've got detention."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Hermione Granger","Good luck, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Professor Umbridge's Class","Harry Potter","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","Ah, Potter. Sit down."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","You will write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","There's no ink."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","Oh...you won't need ink."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","Problem, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","Hey, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","No, I haven't."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Dolores Umbridge","That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Ron Weasley","Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Ron Weasley","Harry--bloody hell!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","He's got to be taken to the hospital wing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Ron Weasley","You said she was making you do lines!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","That old hag! She's sick!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","No, I'm telling anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","Harry, I really think you should tell--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","I've asked Sirius about it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Ron Weasley","Always knew she was a bit fishy."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","You think she's working for You- Know-Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Hermione Granger","I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Detention With Dolores","Harry Potter","Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","And how long have you been at this post?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","I am."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","These things tend to skip...several...generations."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","Of course."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","The Inner Eye does not See upon command!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Harry Potter","Er..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Sybill Trelawney","Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Hogwarts High Inquisitor","Dolores Umbridge","Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Where are we going, Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","There we are."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ron Weasley","""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Come on, I'll explain in a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Hermione, what's going on?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","You mean about us teaching ourselves?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Neville Longbottom","Hey, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Hey, Neville."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Uh...same to you, Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Fred Weasley","Hear, hear!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","That's the first time you've said his name."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Zacharias Smith","How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","George Weasley","Dumbledore believes he is."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Justin Finch-Fletchley","You mean Dumbledore believes him."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","It's okay, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Neville Longbottom","But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ginny Weasley","Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Me?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Michael Corner","I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Susan Bones","One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Uh...well, yeah, I did."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Lee Jordan","Blimey, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Lavander Brown","Wow..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Fred Weasley","Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Cho Chang","And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ron Weasley","Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ginny Weasley","And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Where are we going to meet?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Neville Longbottom","What about an unused classroom?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","That might work. I'll look into that."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Ok, good."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ernest Macmillan","I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Also, what should we call ourselves?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Angelina Johnson","What about the Anti-Unbridhe League?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ginny Weasley","I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","We'll let you know when we're going"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","I think that went well."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","And did you see Cho, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Angelina Johnson","Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","What's she done now?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Angelina Johnson","Follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded.

"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Angelina Johnson","She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it."

"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","This isn't a coincidence."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","She knows."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ron Weasley","She can't!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ron Weasley","Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","What would we do without you, Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Hedwig!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","She's hurt!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Ron Weasley","She doesn't look very good."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Hermione Granger","Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","Where on earth are you going at this time of night?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","London."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","Well, give her to me. I'll run her"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","There you are."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Harry Potter","Yes, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","In the Hog's Head","Minerva McGonagall","Good. Now, off to bed."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dobby","Mr. Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Dobby! What are you doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dobby","Dobby is cleaning, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","What is it, Dobby."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dobby","Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dobby","Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","That's brilliant, Dobby!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dobby","Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Lee Jordan","...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Students","Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Just ignore them, Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Draco Malfoy","I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Hermione Granger","Harry, are you all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Draco Malfoy","Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Draco Malfoy","I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Draco Malfoy","And his pathetic loser of a father too!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Draco Malfoy","But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Rolanda Hooch","Impedimenta!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Rolanda Hooch","Don't make me stupify you, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","My office. Now."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Malfoy provoked us."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","What is it, Dolores?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","Ban us...for life."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","Ah, I'll take your brooms as well."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Dolores Umbridge","Well, have a wonderful day."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","You've--!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Minerva McGonagall","My hands are tied, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Angelina Johnson","I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Ron Weasley","I'm going to resign."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","You can't!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Ron Weasley","I'm horrible! I should never have joined."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Harry Potter","If you quit, we'll be out four players!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Ron Weasley","This is the worst day of my life."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Hermione Granger","I know something that could cheer you up."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Dumbledore's Army","Hermione Granger","Hagrid's back!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Hagrid, what happened to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Rubeus Hagrid","I've fine, I tell yeh!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Ron Weasley","Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Rubeus Hagrid","Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Ron Weasley","A month?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Rubeus Hagrid","O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","So what did you do when you found them?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Ron Weasley","So...no giants are coming?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Glad to see all of you could find this place all right."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Neville Longbottom","Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Zacharias Smith","Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Ron Weasley","Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Neville Longbottom","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Well done, Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Neville Longbottom","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Neville Longbottom","I did it! I did it!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Hagrid's Tale","Harry Potter","Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Neville Longbottom","What's wrong with him?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Ron Weasley","Get McGonagall! Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Ron Weasley","Harry! HARRY!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Minerva McGonagall","Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Minerva McGonagall","Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","Mr. Weasley's been attacked!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Minerva McGonagall","You dreamed this, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","No, I saw it happen! I...I was there..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Minerva McGonagall","You're sure this happened, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Minerva McGonagall","We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Professor McGonagall, and...ah..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","What can I do for you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Minerva McGonagall","Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Is Arthur seriously injured?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","You were listening?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Everard","Naturally."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Fawkes, we will need a warning."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Naturally, naturally."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","What news?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Everard","I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Dilys Derwent","Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Good."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Phineas."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Albus Dumbledore","Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Phineas","It's late, Dumbledore..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Phineas","I'm going, I'm going..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Sit, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","What's that, Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","Voldemort can read minds?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","So he could read our minds right now?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Wand out, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","What are you going to do?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","I am going to break into your mind."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Arthur Weasley","Come on, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","I've been there before..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","I've just realized..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","Realized what, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","What did you say?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Harry Potter","That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Occlumency","Severus Snape","There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","I can do whatever I wish!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Sybill Trelawney","This is my home!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","Not anymore."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","Now remove yourself from this castle!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","I have the authority, Headmaster!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","-..-You cannot send them from this"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","This is Firenze."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Ron Weasley","So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Harry Potter","It's got to be."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Hermione Granger","That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Harry Potter","Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Ron Weasley","But why the Department of Mysteries?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Hermione Granger","It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Hermione Granger","Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Harry Potter","They're all Death Eaters!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Harry Potter","Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","I'm not sure that's true, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","I'm sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","I have a witness right here!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","Let's ask her, shall we?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","You can shake your head for an"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","But what about Potter? He was the"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","Why are you shaking your head, girl?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","Well, what about the meeting tonight?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Well, Minister. You've caught me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Quite correct, Cornelius."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","This is too good to be true!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Harry Potter","Professor, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Quiet, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","I see no snag, Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Are you all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Minerva McGonagall","Yes, we're fine."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Harry Potter","I'm so sorry, Professor!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Albus Dumbledore","Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Cornelius Fudge","Find him!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","""By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Unquiet Escape","Dolores Umbridge","Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Harry Potter","Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Ron Weasley","No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Hermione Granger","Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Its jus' up ahead, here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Harry Potter","Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Hermione Granger","We won't let her!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Hermione Granger","Of course we'll help."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Knew yeh'd say yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Okay, real quiet like from here on."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","There we are!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Hermione Granger","Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Hermione Granger","Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","He's me brother!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Yeh all righ', Grawp?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Grawp","Hermy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","See, he don' know any better."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Oh blimey..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Bane","I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Bane","You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Rubeus Hagrid","Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Grawp","Bane","We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Have you been practicing, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Well, we shall see, won't we?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Sirius Black","Put that away, James."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Sirius Black","I'm bored. Wish it was full moon."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Remus Lupin","Easy for you to say."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","All right, there, Snivellus?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Sirius Black","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Impedimenta!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","You just wait..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","Leave him alone, James Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Another charity case, Lily?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","What has he done to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Semper-——"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Levicorpus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","Leave him alone, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","I will if you go out with me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Sirius Black","Locomotor mortis!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","I said, leave him alone!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Don't make me hex you, Lily."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","Then let him go!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Fine!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Apologize to her! Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","I would never call you that."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Lily Potter","You make me sick, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","James Potter","Lily! Hey Lily!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Having fun, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Been enjoying yourself?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Harry Potter","No!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Amusing man, your father..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Harry Potter","I--sorry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","You will repeat what you saw to no"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Harry Potter","No, of course not!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Snape's Worst Memory","Severus Snape","Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Voldemort","Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Sirius Black","I would rather die!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Voldemort","Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Voldemort","I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Griselda Marchbanks","Are you all right, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Griselda Marchbanks","Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but--—"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","No--no, I've done all I can."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Ron Weasley","You all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","How do you know?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","I just saw it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","How're we going to get there?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Ron Weasley","To the Department of Mysteries?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","We've got to do something!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Ron Weasley","Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","It just seems so unlikely, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","I won't let Sirius die!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Ginny Weasley","We heard Harry yelling. What's up?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Ginny Weasley","Anything we can do to help?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","No, there isn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","Yes, they can, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","How?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Might be able to."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Just give us a few seconds."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","Mind you, it's got to be really good!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","It's been too quiet around here"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Time we did some real damage to this place."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Ginny Weasley","We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","We'll probably only manage five minutes or so."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","That's all we'll need."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Hermione Granger","Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Argus Filch","Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Dolores Umbridge","Ready to try out the old punishments again?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","Grimmauld Place!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","That was worth it!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Argus Filch","I've got you now!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Thank you for playing, one and all."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","And now, we've got to go!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","Sirius! Lupin? Hello?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Kreacher","What's this? The Potter boy in the fire..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Kreacher","Master went out."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Dolores Umbridge","So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Fairly amusing, yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Dolores Umbridge","Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Dolores Umbridge","Well, now you're going to get your"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","You know, I don't think we are."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Completely, Fred."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Time to enter the real world?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Definitely."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Accio brooms!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Accio brooms!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","We won't be seeing you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","George Weasley","Yeah, don't bother writing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Fred Weasley","Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Harry Potter","You know where he is, don't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Kreacher","Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Out of the Fire","Kreacher","Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Accio wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Who were you trying to contact?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","It's none of your business."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Severus Snape","You wished to see me?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Severus Snape","Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Severus Snape","Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","We've played nicely, Potter. You"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","You sent the Dementors?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Of course I did! Someone had to act!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","No! Please, stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Well, well."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","Hermione, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","We have to tell her, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","I would rather die!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Tell him?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","That it's ready. The weapon."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","You and Mr. Potter will take me to it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Much further, is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","Oh, yes. It's very well hidden."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Magorian","What are you doing in our forest?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Stay back, you beasts!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","Don't call them that!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Magorian","You dare to insult us?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Come no closer!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Incarcerus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Dolores Umbridge","Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Centaur","What of these two?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Centaur","They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Draco Malfoy","God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","Shut up, Malfoy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Draco Malfoy","That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Draco Malfoy","You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Neville Longbottom","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Grawp","Haggar!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Grawp","Hermy! Where Haggar?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","Grawp, help us!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Grawp","Grawp save Hermy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","Great plan, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","I thought it worked out rather nicely."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","That's just what we were wondering."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","So, how do we get to the Ministry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","I'd imagine we should fly."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","We've got no brooms."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Luna Lovegood","There are other ways to fly."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Luna Lovegood","I mean, they can fly, and they're"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","What are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","What are what?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Hermione Granger","There's nothing there, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Luna Lovegood","Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Neville Longbottom","I can see them too."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Harry Potter","All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Luna Lovegood","I'll show you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Fight and Flight","Ron Weasley","Never again..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ginny Weasley","What now, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","All right, come on."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Witch","Department of Mysteries."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Where is everyone?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ginny Weasley","The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","This is it. Come on."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Stay close."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ginny Weasley","Now where?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","I don't understand. In my dream,"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Well, let's try a few."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Who's there?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Sirius?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Does anyone else hear that?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Luna Lovegood","I do. It's coming from the Veil."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Luna Lovegood","There are people in there!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ron Weasley","What do you mean, people?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Harry, I think we should leave."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Sirius...yeah..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Alohomora!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","This is it! Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","This is it. This is where Sirius is!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","He's in here somewhere."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","I don't think Sirius is here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ron Weasley","Harry, have you seen this?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ron Weasley","Er...it's got your name on it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","What's my name doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Don't touch it, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Why not?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Yeah, Harry, don't."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","It's got my name on it!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Where's Sirius?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Now give me that prophesy."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","What prophesy?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Go ahead."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Come and find out!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","No! If the prophesy is smashed--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Surely you jest, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half—-blood mouth!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Control yourself, Bellatrix!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","What's so special about this"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","So that's what took you so long. We wondered."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Stop them!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Colloportus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Where'd the rest go?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Harry, they went the wrong way!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Death Eater","They might have gone on to the hall."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Check under the desks."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Avada-—"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Death Eater","Impedimenta!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Death Eater","We've got him!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Hermione Granger","Silenco! Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Pretificus Totalus!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","What's they do to her?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Can we carry her?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","I'll do it. You're better at fighting."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Where do we go?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","I don't know..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","What happened."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ginny Weasley","I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Ron Weasley","Hiyya, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Luna Lovegood","They hit her with something too."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","There they are!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Let my friends go and I will."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Lucius Malfoy","You are not in a position to negotiate."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Don't do it, Harry! Don't!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Stop, Neville!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Neville? Neville Longbottom?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","You put them in St. Mungos!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Don't give it to them!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Bellatrix Lestrange","Crucio!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Harry Potter","Are you all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Neville Longbottom","Yeah..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Department of Mysteries","Death Eater","Give me the prophesy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Sirius Black","Get out of here, you two!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Sirius Black","That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Harry Potter","You come with us!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Sirius Black","You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Sirius Black","I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Sirius Black","Hello, cousin!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Lucius Malfoy","Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Lucius Malfoy","We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Lucius Malfoy","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Harry Potter","Protego!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Neville Longbottom","It's Dumbledore!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Sirius Black","Is that the best you've got, cousin?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Remus Lupin","Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Harry Potter","No...no...no...."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Beyond the Veil","Remus Lupin","Harry, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","You can't stop me, Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Harry Potter","I'LL KILL you!!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Harry Potter","Stupify!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","Come out, come out, Potter..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Harry Potter","Crucio!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","Crucio!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","Give me the prophesy!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Harry Potter","Can't. It got smashed by accident!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","You lie!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Harry Potter","How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Bellatrix Lestrange","Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Harry Potter","He can't hear you from here, you know!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Voldemort","So, you smashed my prophesy..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Voldemort","I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Side by Side","Voldemort","Avada Kadavra!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","You should not have come here tonight, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Voldemort","It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Voldemort","Avada Kedavra!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Voldemort","You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Voldemort","There is nothing worse than death!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Harry Potter","Look out!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Harry Potter","Professor!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Stay where you are, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Are you all right, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Percy Weasley","Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Cornelius Fudge","I know...I saw him too..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Cornelius Fudge","Seize him!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Cornelius Fudge","Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Cornelius Fudge","What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Portus."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Cornelius Fudge","Dumbledore, I want some answers!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","The Second War has begun, Minister."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","Wizards Duel","Albus Dumbledore","Thank you..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Please sit, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","I understand how you feel, Harry--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","No you don't!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","What can't I know?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","This pain is part of being human, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I don't care! I don't care!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Let me out."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","No."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","You can't keep me in here!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","It is my fault Sirius died tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I already know all this."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Well, yeah, I did..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","But Snape stopped giving me lessons."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Sirius hated him."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","I was trying to save his life!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","She never loved me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Do you remember what you asked me that night?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I don't understand, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Professor, why am I so important to"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Sir, it got smashed."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Sybill Trelawney","""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I'm not sure I understand all that, sir..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","And...it means me?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","So it's not necessarily me, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","What if he chose wrong?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","But I don't have any special powers."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","What is it, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives."""
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","One of us has to kill the other...in the end."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Nearly Headless Nick","Hello, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Hey, Nick."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Nearly Headless Nick","I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Oh. Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Nick, I was wondering about something?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Nearly Headless Nick","I've been expecting this..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Expecting what?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Nearly Headless Nick","A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I expect so..."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Nearly Headless Nick","He's not coming back, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Nearly Headless Nick","I'm sorry I couldn't be of more"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","How are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Ron Weasley","Good as new, mate."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Better."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Hermione Granger","Come on, let's go in to the feast."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I've got something to tell you. Something important."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","But not right now. I'm not ready."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Hermione Granger","Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","Hello, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","It's the last night and I need to pack."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","Oh, people take my things and hide them."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me ""Loony"" Lovegood."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Do you need any help looking?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","Oh no. It all turns up in the end."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","My mother. I was nine."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","I'm sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Harry Potter","Isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","They were just out of sight, that's all."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","The Lost Prophecy","Luna Lovegood","Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","A way of coming back","Harry Potter","I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","A way of coming back","Hermione Granger","What's that ?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","A way of coming back","Harry Potter","That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have."
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","A way of coming back","Ron Weasley","Yeah ?"
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","A way of coming back","Harry Potter","Something worth fighting for"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","Narcissa!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","The Dark Lord trusts him."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","The Dark Lord is mistaken."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","Or so I believe."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","Well, who can one trust these days?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","He lives in this Muggle dunghill?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","Run along, Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","I've nowhere else to turn, Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","You must be joking."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","You? The Dark Lord told you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","I... I don't doubt you, Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","He's just a boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","Do you mean it, Severus?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","I can try."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Narcissa Malfoy","Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","Swear to it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","Take out your wand."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","I will."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","I will."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Bellatrix Lestrange","And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Snape's Visitors","Severus Snape","I will."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Waitress","Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Harry Potter","Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Waitress","Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Harry Potter","Really."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Waitress","Thought I'd gone round the twist."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Harry Potter","Hey.  I was wondering..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Who's Harry Potter?","Waitress","Eleven.  That's when I get off."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","I just Apparated, didn't I?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","Can't imagine why..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Wand out, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Lumos..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Horace!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Horace Slughorn","Merlin's Beard!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Dragon's blood."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Take matters into their own hands?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","That was fun.  May I use the loo?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","My mother's eyes, yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","Of course.  But you're not leaving?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Horace Slughorn","All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Indeed they are."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","Sir, exactly what was that all --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Albus Dumbledore","Both are waiting for you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry Potter","Sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Hedwig...?  Mum!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Exactly.  How'd you guess?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","I'm joking, Mum."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Molly Weasley","You're worse than Fred and George."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Molly Weasley","Harry who?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Molly Weasley","I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Molly Weasley","I seriously doubt that."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Harry?  Did someone say Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Was that an owl I heard?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Really?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Really."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Molly Weasley","But why didn't you tell us you were coming?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Didn't know. Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Molly Weasley","That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","You've a bit of..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","When'd you get here?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Oh come on..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Rubbish.  He's only -- what?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Step up!  Step up!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Step up!  Step up!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","We've got Fainting Fancy..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Nosebleed Nougats..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","And just in time for school..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Puking Pastilles!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Into the cauldron, handsome."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Into the cauldron, handsome."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","What'd you think, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Amazing."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","We've got eyes in the back of our heads."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Bloody urchins."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","A real money spinner that."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Yes, they do really work."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Meaning?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","None of your business."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","These are adorable."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","How much for this?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Five Galleons."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Five Galleons."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","How much for me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Five Galleons."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","George Weasley","Five Galleons."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","But I'm your brother!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Fred Weasley","Ten Galleons."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","C'mon. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Lavender Brown","Hi, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Hi."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Fred reckons people need a laugh these days."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Reckon he's right..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Oh no.  Look."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","What're they playing at?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Dunno.  Let's get closer."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Hey.  Where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Harry, where is she?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","I don't know.  I'm turned around."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","What just happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Luna Lovegood","Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Luna Lovegood","There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Luna Lovegood","He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ginny Weasley","Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Luna Lovegood","They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","It's happened.  He's one of them."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","One of what?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Ron Weasley","It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Hermione Granger","I told you.  I don't know what I saw."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","What Could Be Safer?","Harry Potter","I need some air."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","What just happened?  Blaise?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Blaise Zabini","Don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Pansy Parkinson","Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Pansy Parkinson","What's that supposed to mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Hermione Granger","Where's Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Ron Weasley","Probably on the platform.  C'mon."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","You two go on.  I want to check something."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Enjoy the ride back to London."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","Hello, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","Luna.  How'd you...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","I am your friend, Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","That's nice."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Filius Flitwick","About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Filius Flitwick","No exceptions, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","Who are those people?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Filius Flitwick","Aurors. For security."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Argus Filch","And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Severus Snape","It was his father's."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Is my father's.  He's not dead."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Severus Snape","It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Draco Malfoy","Nice face, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","Have you ever fixed one?  A nose."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","What the hell.  Give it a go."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","Episkey."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","Well?  How do I look?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Luna Lovegood","Exceptionally ordinary."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","That's For My Father","Harry Potter","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ron Weasley","Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Hermione Granger","Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ron Weasley","Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ginny Weasley","He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ron Weasley","Looks like his own this time."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Hermione Granger","Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Harry Potter","Later.  What've I missed?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ron Weasley","Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Harry Potter","Thanks..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Hermione Granger","What's happened to his hand?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Albus Dumbledore","The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Albus Dumbledore","Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Albus Dumbledore","Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Albus Dumbledore","Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Albus Dumbledore","Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Albus Dumbledore","Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ron Weasley","That was cheerful."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Minerva McGonagall","History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Minerva McGonagall","Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Harry Potter","This can't be good."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Minerva McGonagall","Enjoying ourself, are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Harry Potter","Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Minerva McGonagall","So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Harry Potter","It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Minerva McGonagall","And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Harry Potter","Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Minerva McGonagall","Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Dark Forces","Ron Weasley","But I don't want to take Potions!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Ron Weasley","Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Harry Potter","Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Hermione Granger","Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Hermione Granger","It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Katie Bell","Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Ah yes..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Hermione Granger","Liquid luck."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Katie Bell","But then why don't people drink it all the time?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Blaise Zabini","Have you ever taken it, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Hermione Granger","How did you do that?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Harry Potter","Crush it.  Don't cut it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Hermione Granger","No.  The instructions specifically say to cut."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Harry Potter","No.  Really --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Hermione Granger","Sh!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Half Blood Prince","Horace Slughorn","Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","So.  How are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","Fine, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","I think he overestimates my abilities, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","Definitely."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","Sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Forgive me, Harry, I..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Mrs. Cole","I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Mrs. Cole","I see..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Mrs. Cole","I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps you could give me an example."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Mrs. Cole","You've got a visitor, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","How do you do, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Mrs. Cole","Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","Don't."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","As you wish."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","You're the doctor, aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","No.  I am a Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps they're right."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","I'm not mad."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Hogwarts is not a place for mad people."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","It's a school.  A school of... magic."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","Who are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","I'm like you, Tom.  Different."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","Prove it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Take it out."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Why did you want these things, Tom?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","I can speak to snakes too."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Tom Riddle","They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","It is unusual.  But not unheard of."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","Did you know, sir?  Then?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","I did."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Harry Potter","Do you want me to let him?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Secret Riddle","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ginny Weasley","Shut It!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Cormac McLaggen","No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","Hard feelings?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Cormac McLaggen","I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Cormac McLaggen","I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Cormac McLaggen","Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ginny Weasley","Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","C'mon, Ron..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Lavender Brown","Isn't he brilliant?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","He's vile."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","Ever heard of this spell?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","Why not?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","It's... old.  The binding is fragile."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","The binding is fragile?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ginny Weasley","Who's the Half-Blood Prince?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","The who?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","The who?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ginny Weasley","That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","Well, I was curious.  So I went to"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","The library."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Ron Weasley","The library."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","And?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Hermione Granger","And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hermione's Helping Hand","Harry Potter","Good.  That settles it then."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","Hey, you three!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","What've you got there, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Filius Flitwick","Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","Who's up for a Butterbeer?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","No.  Over here."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","No, no.  Sit next to me."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","O-kay."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Skinny kid","What'll we have?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Aw, bloody hell..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","And snogging."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","I'd like to leave."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","Leave?  You can't be serious."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","That happens to be my sister."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","Harry, m'boy!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","So what brings you here, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","I'd consider it an honor, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","You'd be welcome too, Granger."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","Be delighted, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Horace Slughorn","Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","What're you playing at?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Get to know him?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Um... You've got a little..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Leanne","Katie.  You don't know what it could be!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","What's up?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Leanne","I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Hermione Granger","I'll get someone --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","There's no time!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","Get back!  All o' yeh!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","Now, now.  Now, now..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Rubeus Hagrid","Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Leanne","It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","Did she say to whom?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","Severus. Is this it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Severus Snape","What do you think?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Severus Snape","I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","Yes.  She was cursed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","It was Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","That's a very serious accusation, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Severus Snape","Indeed.  Your evidence?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","I... just... know."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Severus Snape","You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Minerva McGonagall","I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","What does she see in him?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Dean?  He's brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","You called him a slick git not five hours ago."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","I suppose."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","So what is it?  He sees in her?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Attractive?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","You know.  She's... got nice skin."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Harry Potter","I think I'll be going to sleep now."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Cursed Necklace","Ron Weasley","Right."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","To Hogwarts' best and brightest!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Cormac McLaggen","Here, here!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Neville Longbottom","Which one do I use for the soup?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Cormac McLaggen","Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Marcus Belby","Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Hermione Granger","My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Hermione Granger","No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Ginny Weasley","Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Hermione Granger","Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Hermione Granger","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Oh.  Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","I think I'll be going."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","The shelf, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","I don't really know how to answer that, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","What was he like?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Harry Potter","I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Slug Club","Horace Slughorn","Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Neville Longbottom","Good luck, eh, Ron?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Seamus Finnigan","Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","So.  How was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","How was what?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","Your dinner party."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","Actually, I was going to ask you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","Really?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Lavender Brown","Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Harry Potter","Have it your way.  Juice?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","Sure..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Luna Lovegood","Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Luna Lovegood","Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","Don't drink that, Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","You could be expelled for that."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Harry Potter","Dunno what you're talking about."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ron Weasley","C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Ginny Weasley","What's gotten into him?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Dean Thomas","Ginny!  Let's go!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Students","Weasley!  Weasley!  Weasley!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","Ron seems to be enjoying himself."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Harry Potter","Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","You shouldn't have done it, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Harry Potter","Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Felix Felicis","Hermione Granger","You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","Charms spell.  Just practicing."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","Ah.  Well... they're really good."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Lavender Brown","Oops.  I think this room's taken."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Ron Weasley","What's with the birds?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","Oppugno!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","It feels like this."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Ron Weasley","Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","Have you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","Yes.  Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","Why didn't I think of that?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","So who are you taking?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","Really...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Hermione Granger","Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","But I am the Chosen One."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","How It Feels","Harry Potter","Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Luna Lovegood","I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Horace Slughorn","Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Neville Longbottom","Drink?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","Neville...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Neville Longbottom","I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Eldred Worple","Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","What're you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","And what's happened to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Hermione Granger","Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","Cormac!  That's who you invited!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Hermione Granger","I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Waiter","Dragon tartar?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Hermione Granger","No thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Waiter","Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Hermione Granger","On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","I think she went to powder her nose."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Cormac McLaggen","Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","Dragon balls."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","What's going on back here?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","Not so quick, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","Besides, I only wish to convey a message."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","A message...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Harry Potter","Traveling?  Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Draco Malfoy","Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Argus Filch","Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Draco Malfoy","Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","I'll escort him out."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Draco Malfoy","Certainly... Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Draco Malfoy","Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Draco Malfoy","I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Severus Snape","You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Free Agents","Draco Malfoy","No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Ron Weasley","Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Harry Potter","Positive.  Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Ron Weasley","It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Harry Potter","I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Ron Weasley","No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Harry Potter","Lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Ron Weasley","All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Harry Potter","I'll take your word for it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Harry Potter","So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Unbreakable Vow","Ron Weasley","You die."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Molly Weasley","Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Remus Lupin","Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","I know it sounds mad --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Remus Lupin","Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","That's not what it sounded like."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Nymphadora Tonks","Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Remus Lupin","It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Remus Lupin","You're blinded by hatred."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","I'm not --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Remus Lupin","You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","Open up, you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","Don't trust me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","It's good."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","'Course 'tis.  Made them myself."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","Did you get my owl?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","A Vanishing Cabinet?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","Nothing.  It's still there."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Nymphadora Tonks","It was delicious, Molly.  Really."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Molly Weasley","You're sure you won't stay?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Nymphadora Tonks","No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Molly Weasley","Remus...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","Everyone gone to bed?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","Soon."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Nymphadora Tonks","Sweetheart..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Remus Lupin","There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","Oh my god..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","Harry, no!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Nymphadora Tonks","Remus!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Arthur Weasley","Ginny, stay with your mother!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ginny Weasley","No, Harry!  It's a trap!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Fenrir Greyback","Don't you smell clean."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Hermione Granger","You have to realize who you are, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Hermione Granger","Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Hermione Granger","What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","You tell me."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Hermione Granger","He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Harry Potter","Who could tell the difference?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Ron Weasley","Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Lavender Brown","That's my Won-Won."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Death Eaters Attack","Hermione Granger","Excuse me, I have to go vomit."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Tom Riddle","Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Horace Slughorn","Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Tom Riddle","Intuition."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Horace Slughorn","Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Horace Slughorn","Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Tom Riddle","I know a secret shortcut or two."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Horace Slughorn","Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Tom Riddle","Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Horace Slughorn","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Tom Riddle","I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Horace Slughorn","I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Harry Potter","I don't understand -- what happened?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Harry Potter","But why would he tamper with his own memory?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","I suspect he is ashamed of it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Harry Potter","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","Why indeed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Harry Potter","I don't know him that well, sir --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sluggish Memory","Albus Dumbledore","This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Sir --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Nice."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","The Map is never wrong."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Or twenty."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","I can't stop thinking about her, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Excuse me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Well... Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","Do you think she knows I exist?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","Snogging?  Who're you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Who're you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Okay.  Very funny."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","What the hell was that for?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","No.  Can you introduce me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","How do I look?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Devastatingly handsome."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Damn it all!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","Where's Romilda?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","What's the matter with Wenby?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Hm.  Perhaps you're right."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","I'll ask you not to use that name."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","What's this?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","A tonic for the nerves."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","What happened to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Love potion."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","And a bloody strong one at that."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","I feel really... bad."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","There we are, Potter.  To life!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","I d-don't understand --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Professor!  Do something!!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","He's choking!!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Harry Potter","Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Albus Dumbledore","Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Minerva McGonagall","I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Albus Dumbledore","Why indeed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Albus Dumbledore","This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Albus Dumbledore","To whom might I ask?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","You, Headmaster."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Lavender Brown","Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","I might ask you the same."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Lavender Brown","I happen to be his girlfriend."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","I happen to be his... friend."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Lavender Brown","Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Lavender Brown","Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ron Weasley","Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Albus Dumbledore","Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Ginny Weasley","'Bout time, don't you think?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Horace Slughorn","I've always cherished my students. They're my life..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Perilous Potions","Hermione Granger","Oh shut up."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Hermione Granger","Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Ron Weasley","Huh?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Ron Weasley","Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Hermione Granger","Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Ron Weasley","Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Hermione Granger","Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Ron Weasley","Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Hermione Granger","Right.  Boggled..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Hermione Granger","That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Harry Potter","How are you, Katie?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Katie Bell","Give me a moment, girls."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Katie Bell","I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Draco Malfoy","Cruci--"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Harry Potter","Sectumsempra!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Draco Malfoy","Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Sectumsempra","Ginny Weasley","You have to get rid of it.  Today."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","Take my hand."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Harry Potter","The Room of Requirement..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Harry Potter","Who showed you this?  First."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","See, you never know what you'll find up here."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Hiding the Book","Ginny Weasley","That can stay hidden up here too, if you like."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Ron Weasley","So.  Did you and Ginny do it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Ron Weasley","You know.  Hide the book."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Oh.  Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Ron Weasley","Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Say that again."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Hermione Granger","Well?  How do you feel?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Excellent.  Really excellent."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Hermione Granger","Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Hermione Granger","What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Hermione Granger","No."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Ron Weasley","No."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Merlin's beard, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Well, then by all means come along, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","That would be counterproductive, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","And what makes you say that?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","No idea."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Merlin's beard..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Is that an actual Acromantula?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","A dead one, I think, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","'Arry.  'Orace."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","I'm sorry, I... didn't realize."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Not to mention the pincers."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Through the front doors."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Harry Potter","Oh yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Farewell..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","Aragog."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Horace Slughorn","Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Liquid Luck","Rubeus Hagrid","Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","And Odo the hero, they bore him back home..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Rubeus Hagrid","To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Rubeus Hagrid","I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Rubeus Hagrid","Tha's odd."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Rubeus Hagrid","No idea... no idea at all..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Harry Potter","Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Harry Potter","Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","Please don't say his --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Harry Potter","I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Harry Potter","Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Harry Potter","Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Harry Potter","Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","After Aragog's Burial","Horace Slughorn","Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","How is he?  Horace?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Intuition."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","I know a secret shortcut or two."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Excuse me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Protected?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","How does one split his soul, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Murder."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Horace Slughorn","This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Tom Riddle","Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Sir --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Tom Riddle's diary --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","And the ring...?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","One destroys Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","True.  But magic, especially Dark magic..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","... leaves traces."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Once again, I shall ask too much of you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Hermione Granger","Harry.  It's time."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Hermione Granger","If one wants it to be.  Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","He was going to the Room of Requirement."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Hermione Granger","Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Ron Weasley","No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","But I'm telling you.  I saw it --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Hermione Granger","What if there are?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","I don't know..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Ron Weasley","Good luck, mate."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Severus Snape","Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Harry.  You need a shave, my friend."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","You look the same to me, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Should I tell you to run, you will run."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","You will do so."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Your word, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","My word."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Take my arm."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Being me has its privileges."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","It's there, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Sir!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","You should've let me, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Careful.  The water."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Accio Horcrux!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps not."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","If you would, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Professor... there are bodies in this lake."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Remember... the water."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Oh yes."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","It has to be drunk."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Why can't I drink it, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Professor?  Can you hear me?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Don't... don't make me..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Nooooooo!!!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Make it stop... Please... make it stop..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","My fault.  It's all my fault..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Your word, Harry!  Your word!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","No..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Kill me!  It's the only way!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","I promise."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Water. Water..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Aguamenti."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","You did it, sir.  Look --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Water!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","I'm trying, sir.  I'm --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","Go..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","We have to... go."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Harry Potter","Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Horcruxes","Albus Dumbledore","I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Minerva McGonagall","To your Houses.  No dawdling."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Harry Potter","We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Harry Potter","All right.  Okay."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Harry Potter","Sir, are you... praying?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Do as I say, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","Who else is here?  I heard you talking."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","You are not an assassin, Draco."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","He trusts me!  I was chosen!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Then I shall make it easy for you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","Expelliarumus!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","That cabinet has been broken for years."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","I've been mending it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Draco Malfoy","I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Bellatrix Lestrange","Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Bellatrix Lestrange","Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Bellatrix Lestrange","Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Fenrir Greyback","Do it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Bellatrix Lestrange","He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Severus Snape","No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Severus Snape","No."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Severus..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Bellatrix Lestrange","Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Albus Dumbledore","Severus... please."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Severus Snape","I gave my word.  I made a vow..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","The Astronomy Tower","Severus Snape","Avada Kedavra!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","You can no longer stay here."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Bellatrix Lestrange","Boo."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Bellatrix Lestrange","Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","Go on!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","Go on!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Cruciatus!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Incacerata!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Impedimenta!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Fight!  Fight back, you coward!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","Don't ever associate that word and my name again."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Sectumsempra!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Severus Snape","You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Hagrid... HAGRID!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Hagrid!  You alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Rubeus Hagrid","Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Harry Potter","Hagrid, Dumbledore --"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Rubeus Hagrid","Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","Flight of the Prince","Rubeus Hagrid","An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Minerva McGonagall","Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Minerva McGonagall","Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Minerva McGonagall","You should know... Professor Dumbledore..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Minerva McGonagall","You meant a great deal to him."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","Do you think he would've done it. Draco?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul..."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","Go on.  Open it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","I'm not coming back, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","We reckoned -- Ron and me."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Like that's going to happen."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Besides, he's barking."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","Funny, he says the same about you."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","You're brilliant.  You both are."
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Hermione Granger","Do you think we'll ever... come back?"
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince","R.a.B.","Harry Potter","I don’t know. I never realised how beautiful this place was."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Rufus Scrimgeour","These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  But I say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Hermione.  Your tea is ready, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Hermione Granger","Coming, Mum."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Don't you look lovely.  All packed?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mr. Granger","Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Quite sure, dear.  See the big bold letters that say 'Sugar Free'?  Dead giveaway."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mr. Granger","Mm.  Yes. Hello, kitten.  Don't you look lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Mrs. Granger","Darling, don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company's so clever..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Hermione Granger","Obliviate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Hermione Granger","Goodbye."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Ron Weasley","What are those?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Arthur Weasley","Close the door."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Arthur Weasley","These are for the Order.  So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.  Know they're not alone..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Times","Ron Weasley","C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Severus.  I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.  Come.  I've saved you a seat."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  Are you, Lucius?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","My lord?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Are you burdened?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Narcissa Malfoy","My lord is always welcome here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","You bring news I trust, Severus?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","It will happen Saturday next.  At nightfall."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","And this information comes --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","-- from the source we discussed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Corban Yaxley","I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Death Eater","Well, they've got that right, then, 'aven't they?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Pius, what say you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Pius Thicknesse","One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Severus Snape","To a safehouse.  Likely the home of someone in the Order.  I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Bellatrix Lestrange","My lord, if I might, I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I'd like to kill the boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Peter Pettigrew","Yes, m-my lord.  Right away, my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","I require your wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Do I detect elm?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","Yes, my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","And the core?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","Dragon -- dragon heartstring."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","My wand?  You can't possibly think I would give you my wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Lucius Malfoy","No, my lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  I, of course, take a contrary view.  But we're all civilized here.  All adults.  We can agree to disagree."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Charity Burbage","Severus, please.  We're friends..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Avada Kedavra!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dark Lord Ascending","Voldemort","Nagini... Dinner."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Time for the teary farewell."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","I've lived in this house twenty years.  And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","You think I don't know that?  You think I don't know what they're capable of?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know.  I lost a sister."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Do you have any?  Magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Petunia Dursley","What a cruel thing to ask."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Well, this is goodbye then, boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","I don't understand.  Isn't he coming with us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Absolutely not."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Vernon Dursley","Come on, Dudley, we're off."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Dudley Dursley","I don't think you're a waste of space."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Well... thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","See you, Big D."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Good riddance."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Rubeus Hagrid","All righ', 'arry?  Yeh look fit."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous.  What say we get undercover before someone murders him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Kingsley Shacklebolt","You're more important."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Bill Weasley","Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Wasn't always this handsome."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Dead ugly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Bill Weasley","True enough.  Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fleur Delacour","You are still beautiful to me, William."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Remus Lupin","Just remember, Fleur, once you're married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Nymphadora Tonks","My husband, the joker.  By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","All right, all right!  You'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  We've got to get the hell out of here and soon!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","The Trace?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","The real one...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","I believe you're familiar with this particular brew."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","No!  Absolutely not!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Hermione Granger","I told you he'd take it well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Ron Weasley","Never done that before, have we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Well, none of us really fancy it, mate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Mundungus Fletcher","Technically, I've been coerced. Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I've always been a huge admirer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, Granger, as discussed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Blimey, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Straight in here, if you please."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning.  It tastes like goblin piss."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Just trying to defuse the tension."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Wow -- we're identical!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Wow -- we're identical!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Not yet you aren't."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","George Weasley","Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fred Weasley","Yes, don't fancy this color at all."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Fancy this:  You're not you, so shut it and strip. You'll need to change too, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Fleur Delacour","Bill, look away -- I'm 'ideous."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Ron Weasley","I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Hermione Granger","Harry, your eyesight really is awful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Blimey.  I almost forgot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Right then.  We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Yes?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Harry Potter","Here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","You'll ride with Hagrid."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Rubeus Hagrid","Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Seven Potters","Alastor Moody","Yeah, it's all very touching. Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Alastor Moody","Good luck, everyone.  On the count of three.  One... two --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Harry Potter","Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Rubeus Hagrid","Can't do it, 'arry.  My job's ter get you where we're goin' safe 'n sound -- Mad-Eye's orders!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Harry Potter","What was that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Rubeus Hagrid","Dragon fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Death Eater","That's him!  The real one!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Rubeus Hagrid","Hol' tight, 'arry!  We've got ter get yeh out of here!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Harry Potter","Hagrid... HAGRID...!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Aerial Ambush","Voldemort","Avada..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Molly Weasley","Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Is no one back yet?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","They were on us from the star', Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And You-Know-Who as well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Molly Weasley","Well, thank goodness you two are all right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ginny Weasley","Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ginny Weasley","Oh my God!  George!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","The house!  Quickly!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Molly Weasley","My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ginny Weasley","Remus!  What're you doing!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Are you mad...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","What Creature!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","A grindylow!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","We've been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Who did this to him?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","Snape. He'll be fine, Molly.  But that's Dark Magic.  The damage is done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Someone else is back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Kingsley Shacklebolt","The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Kingsley Shacklebolt","What gave you away?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Hey ya -- Well... thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Nymphadora Tonks","Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Hermione Granger","Really?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Always the tone of surprise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Arthur Weasley","Are we the last?  Where's George?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Arthur Weasley","Remus.  Where's my son?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Fred Weasley","How do you feel, Georgie?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","George Weasley","Saint-like."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Fred Weasley","Come again?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","George Weasley","Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Fred Weasley","With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","George Weasley","Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.  Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Bill Weasley","Mad-Eye's dead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Bill Weasley","Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Arthur Weasley","It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Wha'?  One of us?  Tha's mad.  I'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot.  An' if it was me I'd kno', wouldn' I?  Talk in me sleep on occasion, I'll admit, but there's only Fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides I'd cut me tongue out 'fore 'd betray 'arry e'en in me dreams --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","Wha's so funny!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Rubeus Hagrid","'Ear, 'ear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Remus Lupin","Better."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Garrick Ollivander","No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Voldemont","Then explain this!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Garrick Ollivander","But it makes no sense..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Voldemort","Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Garrick Ollivander","No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Voldemont","I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  I won't be so forgiving next time..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Going somewhere?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","No one else is going to die.  Not for me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Come with me.  Now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","Wedding?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Harry Potter","I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Do you think he knows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Fallen Warrior","Ron Weasley","Won't he know he's being hunted?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Arthur Weasley","All together now!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Arthur Weasley","One.  Two.  Three!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","Were you going to tell me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","I see."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","Zip me up, will you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ginny Weasley","Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that's going on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","George Weasley","Morning."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Arthur Weasley","How's it look on your end, boys?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Fred Weasley","Brilliant!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","George Weasley","Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Dunno.  But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","And this would be...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Don't be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley.  Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","And you, Miss Granger?  How would you characterize your relationship?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Hermione Granger","We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","What's this all about?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","This.  Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  Now why do you suppose that would be?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","No idea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Come now, you don't expect me to believe..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","'Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Ron Weasley","Oh, c'mon!  Beedle's stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","'To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","That's it then?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a second bequest:  The Sword of Godric Gryffindor.  Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.  As an important historical artifact, it belongs..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Hermione Granger","To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger.  That does not make it that wizard's property.  And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","Excuse me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","The sword is missing. I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter.  But I assure you I'm not your enemy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Harry Potter","You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Hermione Granger","Where is your guard, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dumbledore's Will","Rufus Scrimgeour","I came alone.  I don't really need them anymore..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Remus Lupin","We want you to be the godfather."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Remus Lupin","Say yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Hello, Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?  I can see it growing smaller in your eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Very well.  I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Xenophilius Lovegood","Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Nice to meet you, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Xenophilius Lovegood","I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Luna Lovegood","Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Sir?  May I sit down?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Mr. Potter!  By all means!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","The occasional owl.  Though it was strange..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Strange, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","I'm afraid not.  Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Woman","Don't despair, Elphias.  I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no less."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth.  I read your obituary, Elphias.  Lovely.  But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore's life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","I'm sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn't made that mistake, I'm sure.  Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.  You and I both know who that is, Elphias."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Who are you talking about?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Well, I don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out. Bathilda Bagshot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Who? Bathilda Bagshot!  My god, boy, she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.  Don't they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Oh, right.  Slipped my mind..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone.  She'd have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two.  I'm sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","For years now.  That's where she first met Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Harry Potter","Excuse me?  You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Muriel","Of course.  The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.  It was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Patronus","The Ministry has fallen.  The Minister of Magic is dead.  They are coming..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Elphias Doge","Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Hermione Granger","Ron!  Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Wedding","Remus Lupin","Harry!  Go!  Go!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Where are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","This way!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","We need to change."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","How the ruddy --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Undetectable Extension Charm."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","You're amazing, you are."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Always the tone of surprise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","That'll be the books."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","They were after you, mate.  We'd just put everyone in danger going back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","What she said."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Same."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Woman","Wicked scar."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","You're joking."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Down!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Stupefy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Petrificus Totalus! Go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","She doesn't argue."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Lock the door, get the lights."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","It's better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they'll know we were here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","You're the boss. Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","You're the best with spells."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Obliviate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","How is it they knew we were there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Maybe you still have the Trace on you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Right.  Perspective."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","I have an idea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Alastor Moody","Severus Snape?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Mad-Eye...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","What was that about?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Homenum revelio."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","It's a spell to reveal human presence."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","We're alone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Lumos."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Lily Potter","Dear Sirius.  Thank you for Harry's birthday present.  You'd think he'd been born on a broom."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Lily Potter","James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would.  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry.  Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long.  James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice.  By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Harry!  Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Ron!  I've found him!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Did she now?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  I'm thinking maybe she could help us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","Hey!  I think you two better come down here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Harry Potter","To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Ron Weasley","R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Place to Hide","Hermione Granger","Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Stop!  I order you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Ron Weasley","Kreacher..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Been spying on us, have you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","Maybe he knows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Ever seen this before?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","That was Master Regulus' locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","That's right.  But there were two, weren't there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Where's the other one?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","But was it here?  Did you ever see it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Blood-traitor Weasley --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","Ron!  RON!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Answer her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Yes.  It was here, in this house. A most evil object..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","How do you mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher.  But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not.."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","He came in the night.  He took many things, including the locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Kreacher","Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","Find him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Pius Thicknesse","As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this:  You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Cormac McLaggen","My father will hear about this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Neville Longbottom","He's not here, you fools."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","They have flesh memories."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Harry Potter","You mean... it remembers me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Kreacher's Tale","Hermione Granger","When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Harry Potter!  So long it's been --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Hermione Granger","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Kreacher","As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin' 'ouse-elves on me!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.  And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name, which Dobby thought was very curious.  And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","I'm no thief, you foul little git. I'm a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --"

"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Dobby","Master Weasley!  So good to see you again!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","Wicked trainers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Listen, I panicked that night, all right?  I never volunteered to die for you, mate.  Can I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Hermione Granger","Stop lying!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Harry Potter","When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Why?  Was it valuable?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Hermione Granger","You've still got it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Ron Weasley","No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Wouldn't be difficult, would it? Bleedin' gave it away, din' I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license.  Says she's of a mind to lock me up and would've, too, she hadn' taken a fancy to that locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Harry Potter","Who was she?  This witch?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Theft of a Thief","Mundungus Fletcher","Well, she's right there, in't she? Bleedin' bow an' all."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","It gets really tricky."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Correct."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","This is completely mental."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Completely, utterly, without question."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","I'm nobody."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","You're somebody.  Be careful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","Morning, Reg!  Good luck today."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Oh... yeah.  Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Apparently so."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","That's bloody disgusting."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Are those...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Muggles.  In their rightful place."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","You appear to be quite popular."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","The Ministry must be hiring young these days."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","They're not Ministry.  They're Snatchers.  They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","I didn't."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","Cattlemole!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","It's still raining in my office. Two days now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Downstairs...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","To interrogate your wife!  If my wife's blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I'd make it a priority.  You've got one hour."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Oh my god.  What am I going to do? My wife's all alone downstairs?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Ron.  You don't have a wife."

"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","No, that's mad.  You two find Umbridge.  I'll be fine.  But how do I stop it raining?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Woman","Level Two.  Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic Department."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","This is you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","I don't like him being on his own down there."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","You really have horrible teeth, you know that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Ah, Mafalda!  Travers sent you, did he?  Good.  We'll go straight down."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Percy Weasley","Oh, yes... of course."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Witch","Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Pius Thicknesse","Sh...careful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Runcorn."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Accio locket."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","All right, all right.  Let's calm down, shall we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms.  I think none of us will soon forget last month's Poisonous Duck..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","R-Runcorn."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","M-morning."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Ron, it's me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","I understand, Wakinda, but I can't be a party to that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","Hello, Reg.  Isn't Mary in for questioning today?  Try to have faith.  If there's anything Molly and I can do for you --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wakanda","Let me guess.  It's raining in Yaxley's office again?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","Tell him to try an umbrella."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Arthur Weasley","Is that a threat, Runcorn?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Bloody cold down here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Man","I'm half-blood, I tell you!  My father was a wizard!  Look him up! William Alderton!  He worked here for thirty years..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","It's here..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","Reg..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?  Wife to Reginald?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole.  Is this that wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","But I didn't take it.  I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was eleven.  It chose me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","No, no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole.  Wands only choose witches.  And you are not a witch."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","But I am!  Tell them, Reg!  Tell them what I am!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Dolores Umbridge","What the devil are you doing, Albert?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Harry Potter","Expecto PATRONUM!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Relashio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Mary Cattermole","You?  It's you! Reg, it's Harry Potter!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","'Tis, isn't it?  This'll be one to tell the kids."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Wizard","Harry Potter...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Hermione Granger","Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Mary!  Do as I say!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","I'm sorry.  It's just --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Long story.  Nice meeting you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Ron Weasley","Piss off."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Ministry Interior","Corban Yaxley","Seal the exits!  Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Quickly!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Accio Dittany."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Unstopper it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Hermione.  His arm --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Just do it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Don't be stupid."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","It's all I feel safe doing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","What're you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Repello Muggletum... Muffliato..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","They're great."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Make sure to leave some for Ron."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","No problem."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","How bad is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","So where do we go next?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","No, don't!  Don't say it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","How d'you know?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what's that smell?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Dinner?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Tea?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","Is that it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","I know.  I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","... alive."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I hate it.  It's like he's here with us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","That's why we're going to kill it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Dissendium!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Incendio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Expulso!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Confringo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","It's angry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","What're you doing?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I can put it in my bag --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Ron Weasley","Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Voldemort","You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Voldemort","Who was he?  The thief?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Mykew Gregorovitch","Just a boy!  Not of the village. It was he who took it.  I never saw it again.  I swear on my life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Voldemort","I believe you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I thought it had stopped."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Tell me. What you saw."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","He's found him.  Vol--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","You-Know-Who.  He's found Gregorovitch --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","The wandmaker?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Yes.  How'd you know?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he's desperate to have it.  It's as if his life depends on it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Don't -- It... comforts him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","And what gets you through the day?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","We've all made sacrifices, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","How long before he can travel?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","You're not doing enough."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Take it off."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Take it off.  Now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","Better?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Harry Potter","Loads."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Forest Fugitives","Hermione Granger","We'll take turns.  Okay?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Scabior","What's that?  That... smell?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Harry Potter","Snatchers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Harry Potter","Good to know your enchantments work."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Getting Too Close","Hermione Granger","He could smell it.  My perfume."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","We have to leave.  We're not safe here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Then we'll go by foot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","I'm hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","We're all hungry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Leave it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Mum can make food appear out of thin air."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Oh, speak English, can't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","I said leave it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","It'll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Good plan."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","My turn."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","None of us do."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Wizards were here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I don't like this place."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I want to go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I'll tell you in a minute."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Maybe you could tell me now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","O-kay."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","It only takes in that which makes it stronger..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Exactly!  Which means..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","... it can destroy Horcruxes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","There's only one problem..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","The sword was stolen."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah, I'm still here.  But you two carry on.  Don't let me spoil your fun."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","What's the problem?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Problem?  There's no problem.  Not according to you, anyway."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Look, don't be shy.  If you've got something to say, spit it out."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Ron..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","I thought you knew what you signed up for."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah, I thought I did too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","I don't understand.  What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Harry, we weren't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Don't lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Stop!  Stop!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Harry Potter","Go then.  But leave that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","And you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","Me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Are you staying?  Or coming?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Ron Weasley","Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","What?  Ron, no -- please --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Broken Ranks","Hermione Granger","He's gone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","It's a Muggle station."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","You were right.  It's like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","'I open at the close?'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","What do you reckon it means?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","What d'you mean -- wearing it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  Obvious, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Harry Potter","Hermione..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Clues Revealed","Hermione Granger","Don't ever let me give you a haircut again."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","No.  This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Yeah. I think they would."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Is it -- ?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","No.  But look."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Did you know he had a sister?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Lumos."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Ignotus... Hey, Har --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Happy Christmas, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Yeah."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Someone's watching us.  By the gate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","C'mon."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","I don't think this is a good idea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","We look like ordinary Muggles."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","Relax.  This is right.  I know it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Hermione Granger","Omigod.  Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Godric's Hollow","Harry Potter","This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","You're Bathilda, aren't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry, I'm not sure about this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","She's gaga, remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Here.  Let me do that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","His name.  Can you tell me his name?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","She wants us to go upstairs."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","All right..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","She wants me to go.  Alone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","It's all right.  You stay here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Lumos."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Bathilda Bagshot","You are Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Bathilda Bagshot","I have something for you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Confringo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Good.  That's good..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","We got away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Are you alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","You've outdone yourself this time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Where are they?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","For a time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Get to the hard part, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Wizard rule over Muggles."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","And Dumbledore believed in it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","'For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Where's my wand?  I'll take the watch."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","Hermione.  Where's my wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","It's done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Hermione Granger","Maybe we can --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Bathilda's Secret","Harry Potter","It's done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","No..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Lumos! Accio Sword."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Diffindo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Hermione..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Are -- you -- mental?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","It was you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","And the doe.  That was you as well."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No.  I reckoned it was you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","My Patronus is a stag."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Right.  Antlers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","You didn't see anyone else?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Anything?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","And we did, didn't we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","See that?  It knows.  It's afraid. Do it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","All the more reason."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No.  I can't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don't hesitate.  I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Stab it, Ron.  Now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Voldemort","I have seen your heart and it is mine..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Don't listen to it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Ron.  Don't listen to it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Ron.  Stab it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","We were better without you, happier without you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","After you left, she cried for a week.  She's like my sister."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I left."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","You've sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Saving your life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","That too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","And just think of it.  Only three to go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Everything all right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Fine.  Actually... more than fine."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Hey."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","Wo -- hey -- ouch!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","Um... I don't know?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Harry Potter, you give me my wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","How come he's got your wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Never mind why he's got my wand --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","What is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","You destroyed it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","It's a long story."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","Don't think this changes anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Ron Weasley","No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","See me doing what things?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Hermione Granger","What happened out there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sword of Gryffindor","Harry Potter","It's a long story."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  I just... didn't know how to find you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Exactly how did you find us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","With this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","It?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","A voice."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","And what may I ask did I say?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Knew what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","It was true.  Every word."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Yeah..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Engorgio."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Wo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Reducio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","What's going on in there?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Nothing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Maybe a bit more practice, eh?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","We need to talk."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","All right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Sorry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Jesus.  It was there too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","Where?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","But what does it mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Ron Weasley","Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Harry Potter","Not still mad at him, are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Lighting the Way Back","Hermione Granger","I'm always mad at him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Luna?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Keep off the dirigible plums."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","What is it? Who are you? What do you want --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I'm Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long, sir.  I promise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Excuse me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","So.  What brings you here, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Well, sir, we need some help."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","I have expressed that view, yes. In the past.  Would you excuse me one moment.  I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","What's going on here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","He's mental.  Let's face it. Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Do you see that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Well, yeah, of course.  It's massive, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","No!  Don't go near it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Yeah, all right..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Where is Luna, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Luna?  Oh, um, she'll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","You mean this?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","What is it?  Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","The what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","The Deathly Hallows.  I assume you're all familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers?'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","It's in here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Well, there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.  Why don't you read it aloud, Miss...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Ron Weasley","Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Well, there you are.  Those are the Deathly Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Harry Potter","Sorry... I still don't really understand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","The Elder Wand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","The Resurrection Stone..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","... then encloses both in a TRIANGLE. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows.  Together... they make one master of Death."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Hermione Granger","Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Three Brothers","Xenophilius Lovegood","Ah, but your tea's grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Let's get out of here once he's back.  I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","It's obvious, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","The Wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","The Cloak."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","The Stone."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Why the Stone, Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","There have always been Cloaks --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","You forgot the water."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","The water?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","For the tea."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","Did, didn't I?  How silly of me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","No, you mustn't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","You're my only hope.  They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... But it's really you they want..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","Who took her, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","Him.  Surely you call him You-Know- Who.  But his real name of course is... Voldemort."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","Nooooooooo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Xenophilius Lovegood","Stop!  I've got him --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Ron Weasley","I'll do the enchantments."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Scabior","Hello, beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Gellert Grindelwald","Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day.  But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Voldemort","If not you, then who?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Gellert Grindelwald","You're so innocent, Tom.  Like a schoolboy.  There's so much you don't understand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Voldemort","Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Gellert Grindelwald","Can't you guess, Tom?  It lies with him, of course.  Buried within the earth.  It is he who possesses it, even in death.  Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","They exist.  The Hallows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","But he only wants the one, the last one.  That's what he's been looking for."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Hermione Granger","What're you saying?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","The Deathly Hallows","Harry Potter","He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He'll have it by the end of the night.  He's found the Elder Wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Don't touch her!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","Stop it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","What happened to you, ugly?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","What's your name?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","Dudely.  Vernon Dudley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Check the list.  And you, ginger?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Stan Shunpike."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Like 'ell you are.  We know skinny Stan.  Try again."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Weasley... Barney Weasley."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Weasley, eh?  Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Ron Weasley","Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Worth ten times you if I can find him.  Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","How 'bout you, lovely?  What do they call you...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Snatcher","There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Fenrir Greyback","Hear that, ugly?  The list says you're lying.  How come you don't want us to know who you are?  Hm?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Scabior","Change of plans, boys.  We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","What did you put on me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","A Stinging Jinx."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Harry Potter","How long will it last?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Snatchers Strike","Hermione Granger","Not long."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Show me. Get Draco. Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Draco Malfoy","I can't be sure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Lucius Malfoy","Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Scabior","Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Lucius Malfoy","You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Lucius. Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Draco Malfoy","What's wrong with his face?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Yes, what is wrong with his face?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Snatcher","He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was. Ah. Got you. What is that? Where'd you get that from?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Snatcher","It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now. Are you mad? Go! Get out!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Cissy, put the boys in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Ron Weasley","What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Luna Lovegood","Ron? Harry?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Harry Potter","Luna?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it? What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Hermione Granger","I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","I don't believe it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Ron Weasley","We have to do something."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Garrick Ollivander","There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Hermione Granger","Please! please!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Bellatrix Lestrange","Shut up!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Luna Lovegood","You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Harry Potter","Help us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Ron Weasley","Let her go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Malfoy Manor","Peter Pettigrew","Shut up. Get back. You, goblin, come with me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Aah!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Dobby? What are you doing here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Of course, sir. I'm an elf."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Works for me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Luna Lovegood","Whenever you're ready, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Sir? I like her very much. Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Peter Pettigrew","Ow."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Who gets his wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin. Think very, very carefully before you answer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Griphook","I don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job? Who got into my vault? Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Griphook","When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Griphook","There is no place safer than Gringotts."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin. The same won't be said for this one."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Like hell."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Ron Weasley","Expellliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Stupefy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Harry Potter","Stupefy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","Stupid elf. You could've killed me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Bellatrix Lestrange","How dare you take a witch's wand? How dare you defy your masters?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Dobby has No Master","Dobby","Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Harry Potter","Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Dobby","Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Harry Potter","Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Dobby","Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Luna Lovegood","We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1","Sleeping Friend","Harry Potter","I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Shell Cottage","Luna Lovegood","It's beautiful here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Shell Cottage","Bill Weasley","It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Shell Cottage","Luna Lovegood","Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Shell Cottage","Harry Potter","I need to talk to the goblin."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","How are you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","Alive."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","You probably don't remember --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","And brought me here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","You are a very unusual wizard."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","Why did you leave Gringotts?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Ron Weasley","Then you're on our side."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","This is a wizard's war. I take no side."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","It is impossible."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","Alone, yes. With you, no."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","How did you come by this sword?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","It's complicated."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","And she never suspected?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Ron Weasley","Who put it there? The fake."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","Perhaps."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","I have no interest in gold."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","That is my price."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Griphook","I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Hermione Granger","Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Ron Weasley","And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Griphook's Price","Harry Potter","I'm still working on that part."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Fleur Delacour","He's too weak."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","Forgive me if I don't get up."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","Anything, m'boy, anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Can you identify these, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","And this?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Was? Isn't it still?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","He has found it, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Garrick Ollivander","He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","You're sure it's hers?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Hermione Granger","Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","I reckon you should take this then."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Hermione Granger","But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","If I can hold it, you can."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","I'll know. I can't explain. It's like..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","That's a bit scary."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Hermione Granger","It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","No. I just know. When one's near."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Fleur Delacour","This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Hermione Granger","It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Bill Weasley","You're leaving, aren't you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","In the morning."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Bill Weasley","And Griphook?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","He'll be leaving too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Bill Weasley","Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Luna Lovegood","The sky has lost a star."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Luna Lovegood","My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Luna Lovegood","I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Hogwarts?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","It's not the place you left, you"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Luna Lovegood","Neither am I."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","Always good value. I'll miss her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","What d'you think?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","You want to tell me what that is?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","You mean he could see you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Harry Potter","You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He's After You","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell... that's a sight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","Well, how do I look?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Hideous."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I? Hold still..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Goblin","Madam Lestrange."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Hey. Easy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Hermione Granger","He's right. I was being stupid."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","C'mon. Let's do it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Goblin","Identification."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","I wish to enter my vault."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Goblin","I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","I don't like to be kept waiting."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Goblin","Next."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","He's with me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","They know!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","What do you mean?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","And why should I do that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bellatrix Lestrange","No, I most certainly do not understand --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","I'm afraid I must insist."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","Imperio."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Goblin","But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","I'm fully aware of that. I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Goblin","Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I've run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","How long before they come after us?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","What's that? Up ahead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","I should have known --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","What is that, Griphook?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","Griphook! What is that!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","Well done. Hey."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","No."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","What the devil are you all doing down here!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","We need him!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Imperio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","Well done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","No. It's not possible..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Hermione Granger","It looks like it's been down here forever."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","Go on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Hermione Granger","That's barbaric. I..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Griphook","Ready, Bogrod?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Bogrod","Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Harry Potter","Lumos !"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Lumos !"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Hermione Granger","Lumos !"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Ron Weasley","Blimey..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Hermione Granger","Look."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Gringotts","Hermione Granger","No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Ron Weasley","Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Hermione Granger","It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Hermione Granger","Ron, your foot!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Griphook","We'll be crushed! Hurry!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Harry Potter","That's it. Up there."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Hermione Granger","How're we going to reach it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Harry Potter","Give me the sword! The real one."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Ron Weasley","Keep going!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Hermione Granger","Harry! Behind you!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Ron Weasley","The cup!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Hermione Granger","In here!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Harry Potter","We have a deal, Griphook."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Griphook","I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Harry Potter","Griphook! Griphook!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Copping the Cup","Griphook","Thieves! Help! Thieves!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","That's unfortunate."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","You're asking us? You're the brilliant one."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","I've got something. But it's mad."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","Relashio!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","That's your idea?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","Come on!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","It doesn't realize it's free!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","We're dropping!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","I say we jump!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","When?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Voldemort","The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","He knows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","How is it you --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","I saw him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","You let him in! Harry, you can't --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","I can't always help it, Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","Never mind! What did you see?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","What happens when he finds out four are gone?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","You saw it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Hermione Granger","Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Harry Potter","Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Exit the Dragon","Ron Weasley","'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Harry Potter","We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Harry Potter","There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Ron Weasley","Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Harry Potter","No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Hermione Granger","They were ready for us."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Death Eater","We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Death Eater","Perhaps you need some convincing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Ron Weasley","What's he mean by that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Hermione Granger","No, you'll give us away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Final Hiding Place","Harry Potter","Expecto Patronum!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","In here, Potter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Ron Weasley","Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","I know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","Harry! I can see you! In here!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","You're Aberforth."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Where've you left him?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","He's dead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","The Order is finished. You-Know- Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Did he now? Nice job? Easy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","Why should he..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Keep secrets? You tell me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","Did you now? And why is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","I had no reason not to —-"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","You're drunk."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","You know what to do..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Harry Potter","Where've you sent her?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","You'll see soon enough."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","She'll always be beautiful."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","She died very young, didn't she."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Aberforth Dumbledore","My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","Mr. Dumbledore... thank you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Hermione Granger","She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Aberforth Dumbledore","Ron Weasley","Who's that with her? Bloody hell..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","Neville, you look..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Well? Ready?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Ron Weasley","I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Hermione Granger","How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","The Carrows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Hermione Granger","They did that to you? But why?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Seamus Finnigan","Blimey."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Nigel Wolpert","River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","What is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","We don't know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Dean Thomas","Where is it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","I realize it's not much to go on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Seamus Finnigan","That's nothing to go on."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Luna Lovegood","Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Luna Lovegood","The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Cho Chang","Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Ron Weasley","Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Cho Chang","It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Cho Chang","Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Ginny Weasley","Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Harry Potter","Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Ron Weasley","Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Seamus Finnigan","Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Ron Weasley","Shut up, Seamus."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Neville Longbottom","What is it, Ginny?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Ginny Weasley","Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Hogwarts Reunion","Alecto Carrow","Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Severus Snape","Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Severus Snape","I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Severus Snape","For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Severus Snape","Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Harry Potter","I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Harry Potter","And I'm afraid it's rather extensive."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Harry Potter","How dare you stand where he stood."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Harry Potter","Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Harry Potter","I'm a Gryffindor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Voldemort","I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Voldemort","I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Voldemort","Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Pansy parkinson","But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Argus Filch","Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Argus Filch","Oh. Sorry, mum."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Give Me Harry Potter","Argus Filch","Right away."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Harry Potter","Time. As much as you can give me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Harry Potter","Is that possible, Professor?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Harry Potter","I think you're right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Harry Potter","You, too, Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Neville Longbottom","Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Neville Longbottom","To blow it up. Boom."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Neville Longbottom","Wicked."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Seamus Finnigan","I can bring 'er down."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Filius Flitwick","You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Pomona Sprout","That doesn't mean we can't hold him up."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Professors","Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Ron Weasley","Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Hermione Granger","Unless we can destroy it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Ron Weasley","So we were thinking --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Hermione Granger","You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Ron Weasley","You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Harry Potter","Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Duty To Our School","Hermione Granger","Where are you going?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Harry Potter","Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Luna Lovegood","Harry! Wait! I need to talk to"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Harry Potter","I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Harry Potter","We'll talk later, Luna."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Luna Lovegood","Harry --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Harry Potter","Later."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Luna Lovegood","Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Luna Lovegood","It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","You Need Only Ask","Luna Lovegood","He's very impressive, isn't he?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Voldemort","They never learn. Such a pity."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Voldemort","Begin."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Pius Thicknesse","But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Fred Weasley","Nice night for it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Harry Potter","Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Seamus Finnigan","That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Neville Longbottom","You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Neville Longbottom","Blimey."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Neville Longbottom","Not good."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Luna Lovegood","If you're to find her, you'll find her down there."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Luna Lovegood","No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Kingsley Shacklebolt","Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Dean Thomas","Yes, sir."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Kingsley Shacklebolt","Dean!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Remus Lupin","It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Kingsley Shacklebolt","Who said that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Remus Lupin","Me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Remus Lupin","Speaking of quality."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Remus Lupin","You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Nymphadora Tonks","He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Harry Potter","It's you..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Neville Longbottom","Ha! dal"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Neville Longbottom","Yeah! You and whose army!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Seamus Finnigan","Woah! Easy up there!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Neville Longbottom","Sorry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Ron Weasley","Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Hermione Granger","No. Of course not."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Ron Weasley","I've never got this far before."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Hermione Granger","I'm scared."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Ron Weasley","Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Blow For Blow","Hermione Granger","Not this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","I do not answer to that name."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","Are you a friend of Luna's?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","Yes. She thought you might be able to help me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","You seek my mother's diadem."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","Yes! That's right --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","Wait! Please!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","I want to destroy it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory —-"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","Tom Riddle --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","But he lied."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","He's lied to many people --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","Strange... you remind me of him a bit..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","It's here. In the castle. In the"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Helena Ravenclaw","If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","Thank you... -.. then turning..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Finding the Diadem","Harry Potter","Thank you... -.. then running."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","You do it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Yes, you can."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Neville Longbottom","Not good."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ginny Weasley","Ready!?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Neville Longbottom","Are you bloody joking?!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Seamus Finnigan","He's good..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Seamus Finnigan","He's good..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ginny Weasley","What?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Neville Longbottom","That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ginny Weasley","Mad. The both of you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Neville Longbottom","Not good."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Argus Filch","Night-tee night."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Pansy parkinson","You let us out of here, you filthy squib!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Ginny! Neville! You alright?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Neville Longbottom","Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Luna -- ?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Neville Longbottom","I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ginny Weasley","I know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","There he is."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","That's right. I did."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Let's go."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Draco Malfoy","Take my hand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Draco Malfoy","Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","I could ask you the same."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Draco Malfoy","I virtually lived here last year. Remember?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","I remember."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","What's wrong with the one you have?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Draco Malfoy","Easy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Why didn't you tell her?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Draco Malfoy","Give me my wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","No. I don't think so..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Gregory Goyle","C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Gregory Goyle","Avada Kedavra!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Expelliarmus!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","Did you see where it went? The diadem!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Split up!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","Do we climb!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","No, it''ll just follow us!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Here! Take one!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Serves him right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","C'mon! This way!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Brilliant."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Voldemort","Nagini. Come."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","You're bloody well welcome!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","He does."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Where will he take her?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Hermione Granger","Someplace safe."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Harry Potter","No. He'll keep her close."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Look inside him, Harry."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Fiendfyre","Ron Weasley","Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Lucius Malfoy","Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Lucius Malfoy","Of c-course, my Lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Harry Potter","I know where he is."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Sybill Trelawney","There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Luna Lovegood","Thanks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Neville Longbottom","Don't mention it."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","Why doesn't it work for me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Severus Snape","You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Severus Snape","There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","Does it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Severus Snape","My Lord?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","The wand. Does it truly answer to me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Severus Snape","With you, of course, my Lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Severus Snape","My Lord --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","But only I can live forever..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","Kill."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","He Will Come To Me","Voldemort","Nagini! Come!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Take them..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Take them!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Please."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Harry Potter","Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","They are the same..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","You have your mother's eyes..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Ron Weasley","He's gone. The snake too."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Voldemort","You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical bliood"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Voldemort","I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Ron Weasley","Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Hermione Granger","Where is everyone?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Lily... Then..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Petunia Dursley","Lily! Come out of there! Now!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Petunia Dursley","We're going home."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Lily Potter","That's mean."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","It's true. You know so yourself."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","No! Don't kill me!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","That wasn't my intention."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Is this about the Prophecy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","How much did you relay?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","I have asked."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Anything."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","You said you would keep her safe!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","The boy survives."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","He has her eyes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","No one can know. Your word."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","You see what you want to see."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Perhaps. oOh. Severus."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","I was... foolish... greedy..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","For the time being?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","It will spread."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","How long?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Maybe a year."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Well, this makes matters much more straightforward."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","It is not expected that he will succeed."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","You must agree."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","You ask too much."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Tell him what?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","So when the time comes, the boy must die."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Expecto Patronum!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","Lily. After all this time?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Severus Snape","Always... We GO TO BLACK..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Your Mother's Eyes","Albus Dumbledore","The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Hermione Granger","Where've you been?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Ron Weasley","We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Harry Potter","I'm going there now."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Ron Weasley","Are you mad! No!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Harry Potter","It's... meant to be."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Ron Weasley","Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Hermione Granger","What is it, Harry? What is it you"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Harry Potter","There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Harry Potter","I think I've known for awhile."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Hermione Granger","I'll go with you. I/'ll --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Harry Potter","Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Oliver Wood","I'll take him from here."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Ginny Weasley","It's all right. We're going to get you inside."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Student","I kept calling. No one came."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Confront Your Fate","Ginny Weasley","Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Lily Potter","You've been so brave, sweetheart."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Harry Potter","Why are you here? All of you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Lily Potter","We never left, dear."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Harry Potter","Does it hurt? Dying?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Sirius Black","Quicker than falling asleep."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Remus Lupin","And he will want it to be quick."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","James Potter","You're nearly there, son."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Harry Potter","I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Remus Lupin","Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Harry Potter","You'll stay with me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","James Potter","Until the end."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Harry Potter","He won't be able to see you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Sirius Black","No. We're here, you see."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Harry Potter","Stay close to me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","I Open At the Close","Lily Potter","Always..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Boy Who Lived","Corban Yaxley","No sign of him, my Lord."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Boy Who Lived","Voldemort","I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Boy Who Lived","Harry Potter","You weren't."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Boy Who Lived","Corban Yaxley","Quiet!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Boy Who Lived","Voldemort","Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","You cannot help."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Oh, yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Then... I'm dead too?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Not?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Not."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Professor, is that -- ?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Exactly where are we, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Sir --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","I've got to go back, haven't I?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","That is up to you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","I've got a choice?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","And where would it take me?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","On."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Voldemort's got the Elder Wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","True."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","And the snake lives."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Yes."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","And I've nothing to kill it with."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Which would be, sir?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Luck."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Professor."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Harry Potter","Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Albus Dumbledore","Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Bellatrix Lestrange","My lord, let me help you --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Voldemort","I do not require assistance."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Bellatrix Lestrange","The boy. Is he dead?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Narcissa Malfoy","Is he alive? Draco?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Sorting Hat","Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Ginny Weasley","Who's that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Ginny Weasley","... Hagrid's carrying?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Ginny Weasley","Neville, who is that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Arthur Weasley","What's going on here, Neville?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","King's Cross","Voldemort","Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Ginny Weasley","No... NO!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Voldemort","Stupid girl. You cry for that?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Voldemort","While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Voldemort","So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Ron Weasley","Liar!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Voldemort","Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Voldemort","Now is the time to declare yourself."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Lucius Malfoy","Draco..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Lucius Malfoy","Draco, don't be stupid --"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Narcissa Malfoy","Come, Draco."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Ron Weasley","He saved your life."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Declare Yourself","Voldemort","Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Who might you be, young man?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Neville Longbottom","Neville Longbottom."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Bellatrix Lestrange","Someone has to do the washing."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Neville Longbottom","I'd like to say something."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Neville Longbottom","It doesn't matter that Harry is gone. A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Neville Longbottom","This isn't over."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Draco Malfoy","Potter! Harry turns. Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Ron Weasley","Well done, Malfoy!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Harry Potter","Confringo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Harry Potter","The snake! We've got to kill the snake!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Neville Longbottom","Harry! Look out!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Nagini! With me!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Leave her!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","I said LEAVE HER!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Nagini"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Die! Die"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","Not Over","Voldemort","Why do you live!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Harry Potter","Because I have something worth living for."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Harry Potter","Confringo!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Bellatrix Lestrange","Come on, granny, give us your best."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Molly Weasley","Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Bellatrix Lestrange","Be thankful we only took one. Besides..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Ron Weasley","Hermione!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Hermione Granger","Yes!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wand's Choice","Hermione Granger","I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Harry Potter","You were right."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Harry Potter","When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Voldemort","It belongs to me! I killed Snape!"

"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Hermione Granger","What's the matter with her?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Sybill Trelawney","There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Harry Potter","I told you: it's useless to you."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Ron Weasley","Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Hermione Granger","Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Hermione Granger","Something my mum used to say."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Hermione Granger","Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Harry Potter","Because it answers to another."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Harry Potter","When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Ron Weasley","But that means..."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Harry Potter","It answers to me."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Ron Weasley","What do you reckon we should do with it?"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2","The Wizard's Choice","Hermione Granger","We?"
